<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
INTRODUCING THE LOP-EARED ONES AND OTHERS
</h3>

<p>
"By Hobbs," cried Archie, as he began to put
away the porridge, "I feel as fit as anything
this morning.  I'm absolutely safe for a century."
</p>

<p>
"You shouldn't boast with your mouth full,"
Myra told her brother.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't quite full," pleaded Archie, "and I
really am good for runs to-day."
</p>

<p>
"You will make," I said, "exactly fourteen."
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, good-morning.  Didn't see you were there."
</p>

<p>
"I have been here all the time.  Fourteen."
</p>

<p>
"It seems a lot," said Myra doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
Archie laughed in scorn.
</p>

<p>
"The incoming batsman," I began, "who seemed
in no way daunted by the position of affairs&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Five hundred for nine," put in Myra.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;reached double figures for the fourth time this
season, with a lofty snick to the boundary.  Then
turning his attention to the slow bowler he
despatched him between his pads and the wicket for
a couple.  This, however, was his last scoring
stroke, as in the same over he played forward to
a long hop and fell a victim to the vigilance of the
wicket-keeper."
</p>

<p>
"For nearly a quarter of an hour," continued
Myra, "he had defied the attack, and the character
of his batting may be easily judged from the fact that
his score included one five&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Four from an overthrow," I added in parenthesis.
</p>

<p>
"And one four.  Save for a chance to mid-on
before he had scored, and another in the slips when
seven, his innings was almost entirely free from
blemish&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Although on one occasion he had the good
fortune, when playing back to a half-volley, to strike
the wicket without dislodging the bails."
</p>

<p>
"See to-morrow's <i>Sportsman</i>," concluded Myra.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you children," laughed Archie, as he
walked over to inspect the ham.  "Bless you."
</p>

<p>
Miss Fortescue gave a little cough and began to
speak.  Miss Fortescue is one of those thoroughly
good girls who take an interest in everything.  A
genuine trier.  On this occasion she said: "I often
wonder who it is who writes those accounts in <i>The
Sportsman</i>."
</p>

<p>
"It is believed to be Mr Simpson," said Archie.
</p>

<p>
Simpson looked up with a start, and jerked his
glasses into his tea.  He fished them out and wiped
them thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"The credible," he began, "is rarely&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, I pray you silence for Mr Simpson's
epigram," cried Archie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I always thought Mr Simpson wrote verses
in <i>The Saturday Review</i>," said Miss Fortescue in the
silence which followed.
</p>

<p>
"As a relaxation only," I explained.  "The other
is his life-work.  We read him with great interest;
that bit about the heavy roller being requisitioned
is my favourite line."
</p>

<p>
"Mr Simpson and Killick and Crawford all play in
glasses," put in Myra eagerly, across the table.
</p>

<p>
"That is their only point in common," added Archie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, isn't he a very good player?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's a thoroughly honest and punctual and
sober player," I said, "but&mdash;the fact is, he and I
and the Major don't make many runs nowadays.
We generally give, as he has said in one of his less
popular poems, a local habitation to the&mdash;er&mdash;airy
nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was Shakespeare said that."
</p>

<p>
"Shakespeare or Simpson.  Hallo, there's Thomas
at last."
</p>

<p>
Thomas is in the Admiralty, which is why he is
always late.  It is a great pity that he was christened
Thomas; he can never rise to the top of his profession
with a name like that.  You couldn't imagine
a Thomas McKenna&mdash;or even a Thomas Nelson, but
he doesn't seem to mind somehow.
</p>

<p>
"Morning, everybody," said Thomas.  "Isn't it a
beastly day?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll hoist the south cone for you," said Archie,
and he balanced a mushroom upside down on the end
of his fork.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with the day?" asked our
host, the Major, still intent on his paper.
</p>

<p>
"It's so early."
</p>

<p>
"When I was a boy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My father, Major Mannering," said Archie, "will
now relate an anecdote of Waterloo."
</p>

<p>
But the Major was deep in his paper.  Suddenly
he&mdash;there is only one word for it&mdash;snorted.
</p>

<p>
"The Budget," said Myra and Archie, exchanging
anxious glances.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, that's good," he said, "that's very good!
'If the Chancellor of the Exchequer imagines that
he can make his iniquitous Budget more acceptable
to a disgusted public by treating it in a spirit of airy
persiflage he is at liberty to try.  But airy persiflage,
when brought into contact with the determined
temper of a nation&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"Who is the hairy Percy, anyhow?" said Thomas
to himself.
</p>

<p>
The Major glared at the interrupter for a moment.
Then&mdash;for he knows his weakness, and is particularly
fond of Thomas&mdash;he threw his paper down and
laughed.  "Well," he said, "are we going to win
to-day?"  And while he and Archie talked about the
wicket his daughter removed <i>The Times</i> to a safe
distance.
</p>

<p>
"But there aren't eleven of you, here," said Miss
Fortescue to me, "and if you and Mr Simpson and
Major Mannering aren't very good you'll be beaten.
It's against the village the first two days, isn't
it?"
</p>

<p>
"When I said we weren't very good, I only meant
we didn't make many runs.  Mr Simpson is a noted
fast bowler, the Major has a M.C.C. scarf, which can
be seen quite easily at point, and I keep wicket.
Between us we dismiss many a professor.  Just as
they are shaping for a cut, you know, they catch sight
of the Major's scarf, lose their heads and give me an
easy catch.  Then Archie and Thomas take centuries,
one of the gardeners bends them from the off and
makes them swim a bit, the Vicar of his plenty is
lending us two sons, Tony and Dahlia Blair come
down this morning, and there is a chauffeur who
plays for keeps.  How many is that?"
</p>

<p>
"Eleven, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"It ought only to be ten," said Myra, who had
overheard.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I was counting Miss Blair," said Miss
Fortescue.
</p>

<p>
"We never play more than ten a side," said Archie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why?"
</p>

<p>
"So as to give the scorer an extra line or two for
the byes."
</p>

<p>
Myra laughed; then, catching my eye, looked
preternaturally solemn.
</p>

<p>
"If you've quite finished breakfast, Mr Gaukrodger,"
she said, "there'll be just time for me to beat
you at croquet before the Rabbits take the field."
</p>

<p>
"Right O," I said.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you know, my name isn't really
Gaukrodger.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
ON THE RUN
</h3>

<p>
The Major has taken a great deal of trouble
with his ground, and the result pleases everybody.
If you are a batsman you applaud the short
boundaries; if you are a wicket-keeper (as I am),
and Thomas is bowling what he is pleased to call
googlies, you have leisure to study some delightful
scenery; and if you are a left-handed bowler, with a
delivery outside the screen, there is behind you a belt
of trees which you cannot fail to admire.  When
Archie was born, and they announced the fact to the
Major, his first question was (so I understand),
"Right or left handed?"  They told him "Left"
to quiet him, and he went out and planted a small
forest, so that it should be ready for Archibald's
action when he grew up.  Unfortunately, Archie
turned out to be no bowler at all (in my opinion)&mdash;and
right-handed at that.  Nemesis, as the ha'penny
papers say.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" we all asked, when Archie came back
from tossing.
</p>

<p>
"They lost, and put us in."
</p>

<p>
"Good man."
</p>

<p>
"May I have my sixpence back?" I said.  "You
haven't bent it or anything, have you?  Thanks."
</p>

<p>
As the whole pavilion seemed to be full of people
putting on their pads in order to go in first, I
wandered outside.  There I met Myra.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, we're in," I said.  "Come and sit on the
roller with me, and I'll tell you all about Jayes."
</p>

<p>
"Can't for a moment.  Do go and make yourself
pleasant to Dahlia Blair.  She's just come."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think she'd be interested in Jayes?  I
mean the Leicestershire cricketer, not the
disinfectant.  Oh, all right, then, I won't."
</p>

<p>
I wandered over to the deck-chairs, and exchanged
greetings with Miss Blair.
</p>

<p>
"I have been asked to make myself pleasant," I
said.  "I suppose that means telling you all about
everybody, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, please."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we're in, as you see.  That's the Vicar
leading his team out.  He's no player really&mdash;one of
the 'among others we noticed.'  But he's a good
father, and we've borrowed two offsprings from him.
Here comes Archie and Wilks.  Wilks drove you
from the station, I expect?"
</p>

<p>
"He did.  And very furiously."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he hardly drives at all, when he's in.  He's
terribly slow&mdash;what they call Nature's reaction.
Archie, you will be sorry to hear, has just distinguished
himself by putting me in last.  He called it
ninth wicket down, but I worked it out, and there
doesn't seem to be anybody after me.  It's simply
spite."
</p>

<p>
"I hope Mr Archie makes some runs," said Dahlia.
"I don't mind so much about Wilks, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid he is only going to make fourteen
to-day.  That's the postman going to bowl to him.
He has two deliveries, one at eight A.M. and one at
twelve-thirty P.M.&mdash;the second one is rather doubtful.
Archie always takes guard with the bail, you observe,
and then looks round to see if we're all watching."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be so unkind."
</p>

<p>
"I'm annoyed," I said, "and I intensely dislike
the name Archibald.  Ninth wicket down!"
</p>

<p>
The umpire having called "Play," Joe, the
postman, bounded up to the wicket and delivered the
ball.  Archie played forward with the easy confidence
of a school professional when nobody is bowling
to him.  And then the leg-bail disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Dahlia.  "He's out!"
</p>

<p>
I looked at her, and I looked at Archie's disconsolate
back as he made for the pavilion; and I knew
what he would want.  I got up.
</p>

<p>
"I must go now," I said.  "I've promised to sit
on the heavy roller for a bit.  Archie will be here in a
moment.  Will you tell him from me that we both
thought he wasn't quite ready for that one, and that
it never rose an inch?  Thank you very much."
</p>

<p>
I discovered Myra, and we sat on the roller together.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've been making myself pleasant," I said.
"And then when Archie got out I knew he'd want to
sit next to her, so I came away.  That is what they
call tact in <i>The Lady</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Archie is rather fond of her," said Myra.  "I
don't know if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I understand.  Years ago&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let's see.  Are you ninety or ninety-one?  I
always forget."
</p>

<p>
"Ninety-one next St Crispin's Day.  I'm sorry
Archie's out.  'The popular cricketer was unfortunate
enough to meet a trimmer first ball, and the silent
sympathy of the Bank Holiday crowd went out to
him as he wended his way to the Pavilion.'  Extract
from '<i>Pavilions I have wended to</i>, by Percy
Benskin.'  Help!  There goes Blair!"
</p>

<p>
After this the situation became very serious.  In
an hour seven of us had got what I might call the
postman's knock.  Wilks was still in, but he had only
made nine.  The score was fifty-two, thanks entirely
to Simpson, who had got thirty-five between first and
second slip in twenty minutes.  This stroke of his is
known as the Simpson upper cut, and is delivered
straight from the shoulder and off the edge of the
bat.
</p>

<p>
"This is awful," said Myra.  "You'll simply have
to make some now."
</p>

<p>
"I think it's time Wilks got on to his second speed.
Why doesn't somebody tell him?  Hallo, there
goes John.  I knew there wasn't a run there.  Where
are my gloves?"
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't be nervous.  Oh, <i>do</i> make some."
</p>

<p>
"The condemned man walked firmly to the
wickets.  'What is that, umpire?' he asked in his
usual cool voice.  'Houtside the leg stump, sir,' said
the man in white.  'Good,' he replied....  What
an ass your second gardener is.  Fancy being potted
out like that, just as if he were a geranium.  I ought
to wear a cap, oughtn't I, in case I want to bow when
I come in.  Good-bye; I shall be back for lunch, I
expect."
</p>

<p>
I passed Joe on my way to the wickets, and asked
pleasantly after his wife and family.  He was rather
brusque about it, and sent down a very fast
half-volley which kept low.  Then Wilks and I returned
to the pavilion together amid cheers.  On the whole,
the Rabbits had lived up to their reputation.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we <i>are</i> a lot of bunnies," said Archie at
lunch.  "Joe simply stands there looking like a
lettuce and out we all trot.  We shall have to take
to halma or something.  Simpson, you swim, don't
you?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't have to swim at halma," said Simpson.
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow," said Blair, "we can't blame the
Selection Committee."
</p>

<p>
"I blame Thomas," I said.  "He would have
eight, and he wouldn't wait.  I don't blame myself,
because my average is now three spot five, and
yesterday it was only three spot one."
</p>

<p>
"That is impossible, if you made nought to-day,"
said Simpson eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Not if I divided it wrong yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Averages," said the Major to the Vicar, catching
the last sentence but two, "are the curse of modern
cricket.  When I was a boy&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This," Archie explained to us, "takes us back to
the thirties, when Felix Mynn bowled Ensign
Mannering with a full pilch."
</p>

<p>
"Dear old Fuller Pilch.  Ah! what do they know
of England, who only King and Jayes?" I
declaimed.  "Libretto by Simpson."
</p>

<p>
"Who's finished?" said Archie, getting up.  "Come
out and smoke.  Now, we simply must buck up and
out the opposition.  Simpson ought to bump them
at Joe's end, and Thomas&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I always swerve after lunch," said Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"I don't wonder.  What I was going to say was
that you would box them in the slips.  You know,
if we all buck up&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
We bucked up and outed them by the end of the
day for two hundred and fifty.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
GOOD SHOOTING
</h3>

<p>
"Will somebody give me a cigarette," said
Myra, stretching out a hand.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy not," I said.  "Thomas and I both feel
that you are too young."
</p>

<p>
"I don't really want one, but when I'm locked up
in the billiard-room with two dumb men&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We were reflecting on our blessed victory."
</p>

<p>
"Were you thinking of Archie's century or John's
bowling?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither, oddly enough.  I was recalling my own
catch which won the match.  Poetry; let's go and
tell Simpson."
</p>

<p>
"It was a skier," said Myra.  "I thought it was
never coming down.  What did you think of all the
time?"
</p>

<p>
"Everything.  All my past life flashed before my
eyes.  I saw again my happy childhood's days, when
I played innocently in the&mdash;er&mdash;pantry.  I saw
myself at school, sl&mdash;working.  I saw&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Did you happen," interrupted Thomas, when we
both thought he was fast asleep, "to see yourself
being badly taken on by me at billiards?"
</p>

<p>
"Thomas, you're not properly awake, old friend.
I know that feeling.  Turn over on the other side
and take a deep breath."
</p>

<p>
Thomas rose and stretched himself, and went over
to the cue rack.  "You should have heard him siding
about his blessed billiards this morning," he told
Myra.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't side.  I simply said that anybody
could beat Thomas.  Do they play billiards much
at the Admiralty?  I should have thought the
motion&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Take a cue.  Myra will mark."
</p>

<p>
"Rather; I can mark like anything."
</p>

<p>
"Once upon a time," I said, "there was a lad who
wanted to get into the Admiralty.  But his mother
said, 'Not until you have learnt to swim, Thomas.'  So
he had a set of six private lessons for one guinea
before he went in for the examination.  He came
out thirty-eight, and was offered a lucrative
appointment in the post office....  Hence his
enormous skill at billiards.  Thick or clear?"
</p>

<p>
"I will adventure half-a-crown upon the game,"
said Thomas, giving a miss.
</p>

<p>
"Right O, Rothschild.  Now, are you ready,
marker?  I'm spot.  Hadn't you better oil the board
a bit?  Well, as long as you can work it quickly
enough."
</p>

<p>
I took careful aim, and my ball went up the table
and back again, with the idea, I imagine, of inspecting
the wicket.  It seemed quite fast.
</p>

<p>
"One all," said Myra, and Thomas kindly brought
his ball and mine to the top of the table.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy I shall be able to swerve from this end," I
said.  I tried a delicate cannon, and just missed the
object ball.  "I shall find a spot directly&mdash;there's
one under the red ball, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Do try and hit something," said Myra.
</p>

<p>
"The marker is not allowed to give advice," I said
sternly.  "What's the matter, Thomas?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not quite sure what to do."
</p>

<p>
"I think you ought to chalk your cue here," I said,
after examining the position.
</p>

<p>
"I've done that."
</p>

<p>
"Then ram the red."
</p>

<p>
Thomas rammed and all but sank it in the left-hand pocket.
</p>

<p>
"I am now," I said, "going to do a cannon off the
cushion.  Marker, what is my score?"
</p>

<p>
"One, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then kindly get ready to put it up to three....
Rotten luck."
</p>

<p>
"Wrong side," said Myra judicially.
</p>

<p>
"No, I meant to hit it that side."
</p>

<p>
"I mean you wanted a little running side."
</p>

<p>
"This isn't Queen's Club.  Go on, Thomas."
</p>

<p>
Thomas, who had been chalking his cue,
advanced to the table.  "Hallo," he said, "where's
the other ball?"
</p>

<p>
I looked at the table, and there were only two
balls on it!
</p>

<p>
"That's an extraordinary thing," I said in
amazement.  "I'm almost certain we started with
three."
</p>

<p>
"Did you put me down?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not; I shouldn't dream of doing such
a thing.  I don't say I mayn't have slipped down
myself when nobody was looking.  Myra, did you
notice which pocket I was trying for that time?"
</p>

<p>
We felt in all of them, and at last found my ball in
one of the bottom ones.  It must have gone there
very quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Score, marker?" I asked confidently, as I prepared
to continue my break.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're going over the crease," cried Myra.
</p>

<p>
I took my ball back an inch.  "<i>Will</i> you tell me the
score?" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Stevenson (in play) three; Inman, two.  Inman's
two were both wides."
</p>

<p>
Barely were the words out of her mouth when
Inman's score was increased by a no-ball.  A miss-cue
they call it technically.
</p>

<p>
"Three all," said Myra.  "This is awfully
exciting.  First one is ahead, and then the other."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, how many up are we playing?"
</p>

<p>
"Five, aren't you?" said Myra.
</p>

<p>
This roused Thomas.  He had played himself in,
and now proceeded to make a pretty break of seventeen.
I followed.  There was a collision off the middle
pocket between spot and red, and both went down.
Then plain was unintentionally sunk as the result of
a cannon shot, and spot and red sailed into harbour.
With Thomas's miss I scored eleven.  Unfortunately,
off my next stroke, Thomas again went down.
</p>

<p>
"Billiards," he said.
</p>

<p>
"You don't think I want to put the rotten thing
down, do you?  It's such a blessed rabbit.  Directly
it sees a hole anywhere it makes for it.  Hallo, six
more.  I shall now give what they call a miss in
baulk."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, good miss," cried Myra, as spot rested over
the middle pocket.
</p>

<p>
"That was a googly.  You both thought it would
break the other way."
</p>

<p>
The game went on slowly.  When Thomas was
ninety and I was ninety-nine, there was a confused
noise without, and Archie and Miss Blair burst into
the room.  At least only Archie actually burst;
Miss Blair entered sedately.
</p>

<p>
"Who's winning?" cried Archie.
</p>

<p>
"What an absurd question," I said.  "As if we
should tell you."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Dahl&mdash;Miss Blair, have you ever
seen billiards played really well?"
</p>

<p>
"Never."
</p>

<p>
"Then now's your chance.  Ninety, ninety-nine&mdash;they've
only just begun.  This is Thomas's
first break, I expect.  There&mdash;he's got a clear board.
You get five extra for that, and the other man is
rubiconed.  Ninety-nine all.  Now, it is only a
question of who misses first."
</p>

<p>
I put down my cue.
</p>

<p>
"Thomas," I began, "we have said some hard
things about each other to-night, but when I listen
to Archie I feel very friendly towards you."
</p>

<p>
"Archibald," said Thomas, "is a beastly name."
</p>

<p>
"So I told Miss Blair.  For a man who was, so to
speak, born with a silver billiard-table in his mouth
to come here and make fun of two persevering and,
in my case, promising players, is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You'll never finish that sentence," said Myra.
"Try some more billiards."
</p>

<p>
"It was almost impossible to say what I wanted
to say grammatically," I answered, and I hit my ball
very hard up the table at the white.
</p>

<p>
"It's working across," said Archie, after the second
bounce; "it must hit the red soon.  I give it three
more laps."
</p>

<p>
"It's going much more slowly now," said Miss Blair.
</p>

<p>
"Probably it's keeping a bit of a sprint for the
finish.  Wait till it gets its second wind.  No, I'm
afraid it's no good; it ought to have started sooner.
Hallo, yes, it's&mdash;&mdash;  Got him!"
</p>

<p>
"It hasn't finished yet," I said calmly.  "Look&mdash;there!"
</p>

<p>
"Jove!" said Archie, shaking my hand, "that's
the longest loser I've ever seen.  My dear old man,
what a performer.  The practice you must have had.
The years you must have devoted to the game.  I
wonder&mdash;could you <i>possibly</i> spare an hour or two
to-morrow to play cricket for us?"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
A FEW WIRES
</h3>

<p>
A hundred and eighty for none.  The
umpire waved his lily hand, and the scorer
entered one more "four" in his book.  Seeing that
the ball had gone right through a bicycle which was
leaning up against the pavilion, many people (the
owner of the bicycle, anyhow) must have felt that the
actual signalling of a boundary was unnecessary;
but our umpire is a stickler for the etiquette of the
game.  Once when&mdash;&mdash;  But no, on second thoughts,
I sha'n't tell you that story.  You would say it was
a lie&mdash;as indeed it is.
</p>

<p>
"Rotten," said Archie to me, as we crossed over.
(A good captain always confides in his wicket-keeper.)
</p>

<p>
"Don't take Simpson off," I said.  "I like watching him."
</p>

<p>
"I shall go on again myself soon."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's not so bad as that.  Don't lose heart."
</p>

<p>
The score was two hundred when we met again.
</p>

<p>
"I once read a book by a lady," I said, "in which
the hero started the over with his right hand and
finished it with his left.  I suppose Simpson couldn't
do that?"
</p>

<p>
"He's a darned rotten bowler, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"His direction is all right, but his metre is so
irregular."
</p>

<p>
At the end of the next over, "What shall I do?"
asked Archie in despair.
</p>

<p>
"Put the wicket-keeper on," I said at once.
</p>

<p>
The idea was quite a new one to him.  He
considered it for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Can you bowl?" he said at last.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Then what on earth&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look here; you've tried 'em with people who
can bowl, and they've made two hundred and twenty
in an hour and a half; somebody who can't bowl
will be a little change for them.  That's one reason.
The second is that we shall all have a bit of a rest
while I'm taking my things off.  The third is that
I bet Myra a shilling&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Archie knelt down, and began to unbuckle my
pads.  "I'll 'keep' myself," he said.  "Are you
fast or slow?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the faintest idea.  Just as it occurs to
me at the moment, I expect."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're quite right; you can't be worse than
some of us.  Will you have a few balls down first?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks; I should like to come as a surprise
to them."
</p>

<p>
"Well, pitch 'em up anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"I shall probably vary my length&mdash;if possible
without any alteration of action."
</p>

<p>
I am now approaching the incredible.  The gentle
reader, however, must not be nasty about it; he
should at least pretend to believe, and his best
way of doing this is to listen very silently to what
follows.  When he has heard my explanation I shall
assume that he understands.
</p>

<p>
Bowling is entirely a question of when you let go of
the ball.  If you let go too soon the result is a wide
over the batsman's head; if too late, a nasty crack
on your own foot.  Obviously there are spaces in
between.  By the law of averages one must let go at
the right moment at least once.  Why not then at the
first ball?  And in the case of a person like myself,
who has a very high action and a good mouth&mdash;I
mean who has a very high delivery, such a ball (after
a week of Simpsons and Archies) would be almost
unplayable.
</p>

<p>
Very well then; I did let go at the right moment,
but, unfortunately, I took off from the wrong crease.
The umpire's cry of "No-ball" and the shattering of
the Quidnunc's wicket occurred simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
"Good ball," said Archie.  "Oh, bad luck!"
</p>

<p>
I tried to look as though, on the whole, I preferred
it that way&mdash;as being ultimately more likely to
inspire terror in the batsman at my end.  Certainly,
it gave me confidence; made me over-confident in
fact, so that I held on to the next ball much too long,
and it started bouncing almost at once.
</p>

<p>
The Quidnunc, who was convinced by this that he
had been merely having a go at the previous ball,
shouldered his bat and sneered at it.  He was still
sneering when it came in very quickly, and took the
bottom of the leg stump.  (Finger spin, chiefly.)
</p>

<p>
Archie walked up slowly, and gazed at me.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" I said jauntily.
</p>

<p>
"No, don't speak.  I just want to look, and look,
and look.  It's wonderful.  No elastic up the sleeve,
or anything."
</p>

<p>
"This is where it first pitched," said the Major, as
he examined the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Did you think of letting in a brass tablet?" I
inquired shortly.
</p>

<p>
"He is quite a young man," went on Archie
dreamily, "and does not care to speak about his
plans for the future.  But he is of opinion that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Break, break, break," said Simpson.  "Three
altogether."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, is there anybody else who wants to say
anything?  No?  Then I'll go on with my over."
</p>

<p>
Archie, who had begun to walk back to his place,
returned thoughtfully to me.
</p>

<p>
"I just wanted to say, old chap, that if you're
writing home to-night about it, you might remember
me to your people."
</p>

<p>
Blair was about the only person who didn't insult
me.  This was because he had been fielding long-on;
and as soon as the wicket fell he moved round about
fifty yards to talk to Miss Fortescue.  What people
can see in her&mdash;&mdash;  Well, directly my next ball was
bowled he started running as hard as he could to
square leg, and brought off one of the finest catches
I've ever seen.
</p>

<p>
"The old square-leg trap," said Archie.  "But
you cut it rather fine, didn't you?  I suppose you
knew he was a sprinter?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't cut it at all&mdash;I was bowling.  Go away."
</p>

<p>
Yes, I confess it.  I did the hat trick.  It was a
good length half-volley, and the batsman, who had
watched my first three balls, was palpably nervous.
Archie walked round and round me in silence for some
time, and then went over to Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"He's playing tennis with me this evening," he
began.
</p>

<p>
"I was beaten at billiards by him last night," said
Thomas proudly.
</p>

<p>
"He's going to let me call him by his Christian
name."
</p>

<p>
"They say he's an awfully good chap when you
know him," replied Thomas.
</p>

<p>
I got another wicket with the last ball of the over,
and then we had lunch.  Myra was smiling all over
her face when we came in, but beyond a "Well
bowled, Walter" (which I believe to be Brearley's
name), would have nothing to do with me.  Instead
she seized Archie, and talked long and eagerly to him.
And they both laughed a good deal.
</p>

<p>
"Arkwright," I heard Archie say at the end.
"He's sure to be there, and would do it like a shot."
</p>

<p>
Like a wise captain Archie did not put me on after
lunch, and Simpson soon began to have the tail in
difficulties.  Just after the eighth wicket fell a
telegram came out.  Archie took it and handed it to me.
"From Maclaren, I expect," he said with a grin.
</p>

<p>
"You funny ass; I happen to know it's from Dick.
I asked him for a wire about the Kent match."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, did Kent win?" said Archie, looking over
my shoulder.  As I opened it, the others came up, and
I read&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
  "<i>Please be in attendance for next Test Match.</i>"<br>
  "HAWKE"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I got three more that afternoon.  One from Fry,
one from Leveson-Gower, and one from Maclaren.
They all came from Lord's, and I've half a mind to
take my telegrams with me, and go.  Then Myra
would probably get six months in the second division.
</p>

<p>
"But I shouldn't mind that," said Myra.  "You
could easily bowl&mdash;I mean bail&mdash;me out."
</p>

<p>
A silly joke, I call it.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
AT PLAY
</h3>

<p>
I selected a handkerchief, gave a last look at
the weather, which was beastly, and went down
(very late) to breakfast.  As I opened the door
there was a sudden hush.  Everybody looked eagerly
at me.  Then Miss Fortescue tittered.
</p>

<p>
Well, you know how one feels when that happens.
I put my hand quickly to my tie&mdash;it was still there.  I
squinted down my nose, but there was no smut.  To
make quite sure I went over to the glass.  Then
Simpson exploded.
</p>

<p>
Yet nobody spoke.  They all sat there watching
me, and at last I began to get nervous.  I opened
my mouth to say "Good-morning," but before I got
it out Miss Blair gave a little shriek of excitement.
That upset me altogether.  I walked up to the
tea-pot, and pouring myself out a cup said, with
exaggerated carelessness, "Rotten day, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
And then came the laughter&mdash;shout after shout.
</p>

<p>
I held out my hand to Myra.  "Good-bye," I
said, "I'm going home.  Thank you for a very jolly
time, but I'm not going to be bullied."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you dear," she gurgled.
</p>

<p>
"I am rather sweet before breakfast," I admitted,
"but how&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It was too heavenly of you.  I never thought you
would."
</p>

<p>
"I think I shall go back to bed."
</p>

<p>
"It was rather rough luck," said Archie, "but of
course the later you are the worse it is for you."
</p>

<p>
"And the higher the fewer.  Quite so.  If this is
from Breakfast Table Topics in <i>The Daily Mirror</i>, I
haven't seen them to-day; but I'll do my best."
</p>

<p>
"Archie, explain."
</p>

<p>
Archie took up a piece of paper from the table, and
explained.  "It's like this," he said.  "I came
down first and looked at the weather, and said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Anyone would," I put in quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, Blair came in and said, 'Beastly
day,' and then Simpson&mdash;&mdash;  Well, I thought I'd
write down everybody's first remark, to see if
anybody let the weather alone.  Here they are."
</p>

<p>
"It's awful," put in Myra, "to have one's remarks
taken down straight off.  I've quite forgotten what
I said."
</p>

<p>
This was the list:
</p>

<p>
<i>Archie</i>: "Bother."  (So he says.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Blair</i>: "What a beastly day!"
</p>

<p>
<i>Simpson</i>: "What a jolly day!"
</p>

<p>
<i>The Major</i>: "Well, not much cricket to-day, hey?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Myra</i>: "Oh dear, what a day!"
</p>

<p>
<i>Miss Blair</i>: "What a terrible day!"
</p>

<p>
<i>Miss Fortescue</i>: "Oh, you poor men&mdash;what a day!"
</p>

<p>
<i>Thomas</i>: "Rotten day, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Me</i>: "Rotten day, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think much of Thomas's remark," I said.
</p>

<p>
Later on in the morning we met (all except the
Major, that is) in the room which Myra calls hers and
Archie calls the nursery, and tried to think of
something to do.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to play bridge all day for anyone,"
said Archie.
</p>

<p>
"The host should lay himself out to amuse his
guests," said Myra.
</p>

<p>
"Otherwise, his guests will lay him out," I warned
him, "to amuse themselves."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you all want to do?"
</p>

<p>
"I should like to look at a photograph album," said
Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"Stump cricket."
</p>

<p>
"What about hide-and-seek?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I've got it," cried Archie; "we'll be boy
scouts."
</p>

<p>
"Hooray!" cried everybody else.
</p>

<p>
Archie was already on his hands and knees.
"Ha!" he said, "is that the spoor of the white ant
that I see before me?  Spoorly not.  I have but
been winded by the water-beetle.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Sound, sound the trumpet, beat the drum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the scouting world proclaim<br>
  One crowded stalk upon the turn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is worth an age without a name."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Archie!" shrieked Myra in horror.  "It is too
late," she added, "all the ladies have swooned."
</p>

<p>
We arranged sides.  Myra and I and Simpson and
Thomas against the others.  They were to start
first.
</p>

<p>
"This isn't simply hide-and-seek," said Archie, as
they went off.  "You've got to track us fairly.  We
shall probably 'blaze' door-posts.  When you hear
the bleat of a tinned sardine that means we're ready.
Keep your eyes skinned, my hearties, and heaven
defend the right."
</p>

<p>
"We ought to have bare knees really," said Myra,
when they'd gone.  "Boy scouts always do.  So that
when they go through a bed of nettles they know
they've been."
</p>

<p>
"I shall stalk the stairs to begin with," I said.
"Simpson, you go down the back way and look as
much like a vacuum-cleaner as possible.  Then they
won't notice you.  Thomas and Myra&mdash;&mdash;  Hush!
Listen!  Was that the bleat of a fresh sardine or
the tinned variety?"
</p>

<p>
"Tinned," said Myra.  "Let's go."
</p>

<p>
We went.  I took the Queen Anne staircase on
my&mdash;in the proper stalking position.  I moved very
slowly, searching for spoor.  Half-way down the
stairs my back fin slipped and I shot over the old oak
at a tremendous pace, landing in the hall like a
Channel swimmer.  Looking up, I saw Thomas in
front of me.  He was examining the door for
"blazes."  Myra was next to him, her ear to the
ground, listening for the gallop of horses' hoofs.  I
got up and went over to them.
</p>

<p>
"Hast seen aught of a comely wench in parlous
case, hight Mistress Dahlia?" I asked Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"Boy scouts don't talk like that," he said gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon.  I was thinking that I was a
Cavalier and you were a Roundhead.  Now I
perceive that you are just an ordinary fathead."
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Myra at the foot of the stairs, "what
does this button mean?  Have I found a clue?"
</p>

<p>
I examined it, and then I looked at my own coat.
</p>

<p>
"You have," I said.  "Somebody has been down
those stairs quite recently, for the button is still
warm."
</p>

<p>
"Where is Scout Simpson?"
</p>

<p>
At that moment he appeared breathless with
excitement.
</p>

<p>
"I have had an adventure," he said hurriedly,
without saluting.  "I was on the back stairs looking
like a vacuum-cleaner when suddenly Archie and Miss
Blair appeared.  They looked right at me, but didn't
seem to penetrate my disguise.  Archie, in fact, leant
against me, and said to Miss Blair: 'I will now tell
you of my secret mission.  I carry caviare&mdash;I mean
despatches&mdash;to the general.  Breathe but a word of
this to the enemy, and I miss the half-holiday on
Saturday.  Come, let us be going, but first to burn
the secret code.'  And&mdash;and then he struck a match
on me, and burned it."
</p>

<p>
Myra gurgled and hastily looked solemn again.
"Proceed, Scout Simpson," she said, "for the night
approaches apace."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then they started down the stairs, and
I went after them on my&mdash;scouting, you know.  I
made rather a noise at one corner, and Archie looked
round at me, and said to Miss Blair: 'The tadpoles
are out full early.  See yonder where one lies
basking.'  And he came back, and put his foot on me and
said, 'Nay, 'tis but a shadow.  Let us return right
hastily.  Yet tarry a moment, what time I lay a false
trail.'  So they tarried and he wrote a note and
dropped it on me.  And, afterwards, I got up and
here it is."
</p>

<p>
"The secret despatch," cried Myra.
</p>

<p>
"It's addressed to the Scoutmistress, and it says
outside: 'Private, not to be opened till Christmas
Day.'"
</p>

<p>
Myra opened it and read: "Your blessed scouts
are everywhere.  Let me just have five minutes with
her in the nursery, there's a dear.  I'd do as much
for you."
</p>

<p>
But she didn't read it aloud, and I didn't see it till
some time afterwards.  She simply put it away, and
smiled, and announced that the scouts would now
adjourn to the billiard-room for pemmican and other
refreshments; which they did.  The engagement
was announced that evening.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
IN AND OUT
</h3>

<p>
"Well," said Thomas, "how are we going to
celebrate the joyful event?"
</p>

<p>
We were sitting on the lawn, watching Blair and
Miss Fortescue play croquet.  Archie and Dahlia
were not with us; they had (I suppose) private
matters to discuss.  Our match did not begin for
another hour, happily for the lovers; happily also
for the croquet-players, who had about fifty-six more
hoops, posts, flags and what not to negotiate.
</p>

<p>
"It's awfully difficult to realise it," said Myra.
"My own brother!  Just fancy&mdash;I can hardly
believe it."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think there can be any doubt," I said.
"Something's happened to him, anyhow&mdash;he's
promised to put me in first to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Let's have a dance to-morrow night," continued
Thomas, relentlessly pursuing his original idea.
"And we'll all dance with Miss Blair."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Archie would like that."
</p>

<p>
"I remember, some years ago, when I was in
Spain," said Simpson&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"This," I murmured appreciatively, "is how all
the best stories begin."  And I settled myself more
comfortably in my chair.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Simpson, "I'm wrong there.  It was
in Hampstead."  And he returned to his meditations.
</p>

<p>
"Tell you what," said Thomas, "you ought to
write 'em an ode, Simpson."
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing that rhymes with the lady."
</p>

<p>
"There's hair," I said quite unintentionally.
</p>

<p>
"I meant with Dahlia."
</p>

<p>
"My dear man, there are heaps.  Why, there's azalea."
</p>

<p>
"That's only one."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there are lots of different kinds of azalea."
</p>

<p>
"Any rhymes for Archie and Mannering?" said
Simpson scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  And Simpson.  You might end with
him&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Forgive the way the metre limps on,<br>
  It's always like that with Samuel Simpson.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
You get the idea?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush," said Myra, "Miss Fortescue has passed
under a hoop."
</p>

<p>
But it is time that we got on to my innings.  Archie
managed to win the toss, and, as he had promised,
took me in with him.  It was the proudest and most
nervous moment of my life.
</p>

<p>
"I've never been in first before," I said, as we
walked to the wickets.  "Is there any little etiquette
to observe?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, rather.  Especially, if you're going to take
first ball."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there's no doubt about my taking the <i>first</i>
ball."
</p>

<p>
"In that case the thing to remember is, that when
the umpire calls 'play' the side refusing to play
loses the match."
</p>

<p>
"Then it all rests on me?  Your confidence in me
must be immense.  I think I shall probably consent
to play."
</p>

<p>
I obtained guard and took my stand at the wicket.
Most cricketers nowadays, I am told, adopt the
"two-eyed stance," but for myself I still stick to the good
old two-legged one.  It seems to me to be less wearing.
My style, I should observe, blends happily the
dash of a Joseph Vine with the patience of a Kenneth
Hutchings; and after a long innings I find a glass
of&mdash;&mdash;  I've forgotten the name of it now, but I know
I find it very refreshing.
</p>

<p>
Being the hero (you will admit that&mdash;after my hat
trick) of this true story, I feel I must describe my
innings carefully.  Though it only totalled seventeen,
there was this to be said for it: it is the only
innings of less than a hundred ever made by a hero.
</p>

<p>
It began with a cut to square leg, for which we ran
a forced single, and followed on with a brace of ones in
the direction of fine slip.  After that, I stopped the
bowler in the middle of his run-up, and signalled to a
spectator to move away from the screen.  This was
a put-up job with Myra, and I rather hoped they
would give me something for it, but apparently they
didn't.  At the end of the over, I went up and talked
to Archie.  In first-class cricket, the batsmen often
do this, and it impresses the spectators immensely.
</p>

<p>
I said, "I bet you a shilling I'm out next over."
</p>

<p>
He said, "I won't take you."
</p>

<p>
I said, "Then I huff you," and went back to my
crease.
</p>

<p>
My next scoring stroke was a two-eyed hook over
point's head, and then Archie hit three fours running.
I had another short conversation with him, in the
course of which I recited two lines from Shakespeare
and asked him a small but pointed conundrum, and
afterwards I placed the ball cleverly to mid-off, the
agility of the fieldsman, however, preventing any
increment, unearned or otherwise.  Finally, I gave
my cap to the umpire, made some more ones, changed
my bat, and was caught at the wicket.
</p>

<p>
"I hit it," I said, as I walked away.  I said it to
nobody in particular, but the umpire refused to alter
his decision.
</p>

<p>
"I congratulate you," said Miss Blair, when I was
sitting down again.
</p>

<p>
"I was just going to do that to you," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you were kind enough to do that last
night."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, this is extra.  I've just been batting out there
with your young man.  Perhaps you noticed?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think I must have."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Well, I wanted to tell you that I think he
has quite an idea of the game, and that with more
experience he would probably be good enough to
play for&mdash;for Surrey.  Second eleven.  Yes.  At
hockey."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you so much.  You've known him a long
time, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
"We were babes together, madam.  At least,
simultaneously.  We actually met at school.  He had
blue eyes and curly hair, and fought the captain on
the very first day.  On the second day his hair was
still curly, but he had black eyes.  On the third day
he got into the cricket eleven, and on the fourth he
was given his footer cap.  Afterwards he sang in the
choir, and won the competition for graceful diving.
It was not until his second term that the headmaster
really began to confide in him.  By the way, is this
the sort of thing you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," smiled Dahlia.  "Something like that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then we went to Cambridge together.  He
never did much work, but his algebra paper in the
Little Go was so brilliant that they offered him the
Senior Wranglership.  He refused on the ground that
it might interfere with his training for the tug of war,
for which he had just obtained his blue&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;  It's
a great strain making all this up.  Do you mind
if I stop now?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I know that isn't all true, but he is
like that, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"He is.  He put me in first to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I know you really are fond of him."
</p>

<p>
"Lorblessyou&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"That makes you my friend, too."
</p>

<p>
"Of course."  I patted her hand.  "That reminds
me&mdash;as a friend I feel bound to warn you that
there is a person about in the neighbourhood called
Samuel Simpson who meditates an evil design upon
you and yours.  In short, a poem.  In this he will
liken you to the azalea, which I take to be a kind of
shrubby plant."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, well, all I want to say is, if he comes round
with the hat afterwards, don't put anything in."
</p>

<p>
"Poor man," smiled Dahlia.  "That's his living,
isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  That's why I say don't put anything in."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Oh, there&mdash;he's out.  Poor Archie."
</p>

<p>
"Are you very sorry?" I said, smiling at her.
"I'm just going, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Between ourselves," I said later to Myra, "that
isn't at all a bad girl."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fancy!"
</p>

<p>
"But I didn't come to talk about her.  I came to
talk about my seventeen."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do let's."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Er&mdash;you begin."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
ALL OVER
</h3>

<p>
"May I have a dance?" I asked Miss Blair.
</p>

<p>
She put her head on one side and considered.
</p>

<p>
"One, two, three&mdash;the next but <i>five</i>," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  That sounds a lot; is it only one?"
</p>

<p>
"You may have two running then, if you like."
</p>

<p>
"What about two running, and one hopping, and
one really gliding?  Four altogether."
</p>

<p>
"We'll see," said Miss Blair gravely.
</p>

<p>
Myra, who was being very busy, came up and
dragged me away.
</p>

<p>
"I want to introduce you to somebody.  I say,
have you seen Thomas?"
</p>

<p>
"It's no earthly good introducing me to Thomas
again."
</p>

<p>
"He's so important because he thinks the dance
was his idea; of course I'd meant to have it all
along.  There she is&mdash;her name's Dora Dalton.  I
think it's Dora."
</p>

<p>
"I shall call her Dora, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
I was introduced, and we had a very jolly waltz
together.  She danced delightfully; and when we
had found a comfortable corner she began to talk.
</p>

<p>
She said, "Do you play cricket?"
</p>

<p>
I was rather surprised, but I kept quite cool, and
said, "Yes."
</p>

<p>
"My brother's very fond of it.  He is very good
too.  He was playing here yesterday against Mr
Mannering's team, and made six, and then the
umpire gave him out; but he wasn't out really, and
he was very angry.  I don't wonder, do you?"
</p>

<p>
I had a sudden horrible suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"Did you say your name was Dora&mdash;I mean his
name was Dalton?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And just because he was angry, which anybody
would be, the wicket-keeper was very rude, and
told him to go home and&mdash;and bake his head."
</p>

<p>
"Not bake," I said gently, my suspicion having
now become almost a certainty.  "Boil."
</p>

<p>
"Go home, and boil his head," she repeated
indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"And did he?"
</p>

<p>
"Did he what?"
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;did he understand&mdash;I mean, don't you think
your brother may have misunderstood?  I can't
believe that a wicket-keeper would ever demean
himself by using the word 'boil.'  Not as you might say
boil.  'Cool his head' was probably the expression&mdash;it
was a very hot day, I remember.  And ... ah,
there's the music beginning again.  Shall we go
back?"
</p>

<p>
I am afraid Miss Dalton's version of the incident
was not quite accurate.
</p>

<p>
What had happened was this: I had stumped the
fellow, when he was nearly a mile and a half outside
his crease; and when he got back to it some minutes
later, and found the umpire's hand up, he was
extremely indignant and dramatic about it.  Quite to
myself, <i>sotto voce</i> as it were, I murmured, "Oh, go
home!" and I may have called attention in some
way to the "bails."  But as to passing any remarks
about boiling heads&mdash;well, it simply never occurred
to me.
</p>

<p>
I had a dance with Myra shortly after this.  She
had been so busy and important that I felt quite a
stranger.  I adapted my conversation accordingly.
</p>

<p>
"It's a very jolly floor, isn't it?" I said, as I
brought her an ice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes!" said Myra in the same spirit.
</p>

<p>
"Have you been to many floors&mdash;I mean dances,
lately?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes!"
</p>

<p>
"So have I.  I think dances have been very late
lately.  I think when the floor's nice it doesn't
matter about the ices.  Don't you think the band is
rather too elastic&mdash;I mean keeps very good time?
I think so long as the time is good it doesn't matter
about the floor."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>isn't</i> it?" said Myra enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
There was a pleasant pause while we both thought
of something else to say.
</p>

<p>
"Have you," we began.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," we said at once.
</p>

<p>
"I was going to say," Myra went on, "have you
read any nice books lately, or are you fonder of
tennis?"
</p>

<p>
"I like reading nice books <i>about</i> tennis," I said.
"If they <i>are</i> nice books, and are really about tennis.
Er&mdash;do you live in London?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It is so handy for the theatres, isn't it?
There is no place exactly like London, is there?  I
mean it's so different."
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course, up in Liverpool we do get the
trams, you know, now....  I say, I'm tired of
pretending I've only just met you.  Let's talk
properly."
</p>

<p>
At this moment we heard a voice say, "Let's try in
here," and Archie and Dahlia appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo! here's the happy pair," said Myra.
</p>

<p>
They came in and looked at us diffidently.  I leant
back and gazed at the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
"Were you just going?" said Archie.
</p>

<p>
"We were not," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Then we'll stay and talk to you."
</p>

<p>
"We were in the middle of an important conversation."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't mind us."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  It's really for your benefit, so
you'd better listen.  Let me see, where were we?
Oh yes, 'One pound of beef, ninepence; three pounds
of potatoes, fourpence; one piece of emery paper
for the blanc-mange, tuppence; one pound of
india-rubber&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"'Dahlia <i>darling</i>,'" interrupted Myra, in a fair
imitation of Archie's voice, "'how often have I told
you that we <i>can't</i> afford india-rubber in the cake?
Just a few raisins and a cherry is really all you want.
You <i>mustn't</i> be so extravagant.'"
</p>

<p>
"'Dearest, I do try; and after all, love, it wasn't
<i>I</i> who fell into the cocoa last night.'"
</p>

<p>
"'I didn't fall in, I simply dropped my pipe in, and
it was you insisted on pouring it away afterwards.
And then, look at this&mdash;<i>One yard, of lace</i>, 4s. 6d.
That's for the cutlets, I suppose.  For people in our
circumstances paper frillings are <i>quite</i> sufficient.'"
</p>

<p>
Archie and Dahlia listened to us with open mouths.
Then they looked at each other, and then at us again.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any more?" asked Archie.
</p>

<p>
"There's lots more, but we've forgotten it."
</p>

<p>
"You aren't ill or anything?"
</p>

<p>
"We are both perfectly well."
</p>

<p>
"How's Miss Dalton?"
</p>

<p>
"Dora," I said, "is also well.  So is Miss Fortescue
and so is Thomas.  We are all well."
</p>

<p>
"I thought, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, there you are wrong."
</p>

<p>
"I expect it's just the heat and the excitement,"
said Dahlia, with a smile.  "It takes some people
like that."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you miss our little parable," said Myra.
</p>

<p>
"We do.  Come on, Dahlia."
</p>

<p>
"You'll pardon me, Archibald, but Miss Blair is
dancing this with me."
</p>

<p>
Archie objected strongly, but I left, him with Myra,
and took Miss Blair away.  We sat on the stairs and
thought.
</p>

<p>
"It has been a lovely week," said Dahlia.
</p>

<p>
"It has," I agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps more lovely for me than for you."
</p>

<p>
"That's just where I don't agree with you.  You
know, we think it's greatly over-rated.  Falling in
love, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Who's 'we'?"
</p>

<p>
"Myra and I.  We've been talking it over.  That's
why we rather dwelt upon the sordid side of it just
now.  I suppose we didn't move you at all?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Dahlia, "we're settled."
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly it," I said.  "I should hate to be
settled.  It's so much more fun like this.  Myra quite
agrees with me."
</p>

<p>
Dahlia smiled to herself.  "But perhaps some
day," she began.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I never look more than a week
ahead.  'It has been great fun this week, and it will
probably be great fun next week.'  That's my
motto."
</p>

<p>
"Well, ye&mdash;es," said Miss Blair doubtfully.
</p>

PART II
</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
ONE OF THE PLAYERS
</h3>

<p>
"Do I know everybody?" I asked Myra towards
the end of the dinner, looking round
the table.
</p>

<p>
"I think so," said Myra.  "If there's anybody
you don't see in the window ask for him."
</p>

<p>
"I can see most of them.  Who's that tall handsome
fellow grinning at me now?"
</p>

<p>
"Me," said Archie, smiling across at us.
</p>

<p>
"Go away," said Myra.  "Gentlemen shouldn't
eavesdrop.  This is a perfectly private conversation."
</p>

<p>
"You've got a lady on each side of you," I said
heatedly, "why don't you talk to <i>them</i>?  It's simply
scandalous that Myra and I can't get a moment to
ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"They're both busy; they won't have anything to
say to me."
</p>

<p>
"Then pull a cracker with yourself.  Surely you
can think of something, my lad."
</p>

<p>
"He has a very jealous disposition," said Myra,
"and whenever Dahlia&mdash;&mdash;  Bother, he's not
listening."
</p>

<p>
I looked round the table again to see if I could spy
a stranger.
</p>

<p>
"There's a man over there&mdash;who's he?  Where
this orange is pointing."
</p>

<p>
"Oranges don't point.  Waggle your knife round.
Oh, him?  Yes, he's a friend of Archie's&mdash;Mr
Derry."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?  Does he do anything exciting?"
</p>

<p>
"He does, rather.  You know those little riddles
in the Christmas crackers?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Well, he couldn't very well do those,
because he's an electrical engineer."
</p>

<p>
"But why&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't.  I simply asked you if you knew
them.  And he plays the piano beautifully, and he's
rather a good actor, and he never gets up till about
ten.  Because his room is next to mine, and you can
hear everything, and I can hear him not getting up."
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't sound much like an electrical
engineer.  You ask him suddenly what amperes are
a penny, and see if he turns pale.  I expect he makes
up the riddles, after all.  Simpson only does the
mottoes, I know.  Now talk to Thomas for a bit
while I drink my orange."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes elapsed, or transpired (whichever it
is), before I was ready to talk again.  Generally, after
an orange, I want to have a bath and go straight off
to bed, but this particular one had not been so
all-overish as usual.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," I said, as I examined the crystallised
fruit, "I'm with you in one minute."
</p>

<p>
Myra turned round and looked absently at me.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how to begin," she said to herself.
</p>

<p>
"The beginning's easy enough," I explained, as I
took a dish of green sweets under my charge, "it's
the knowing when to stop."
</p>

<p>
"Can you eat those and listen to something serious?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll try....  Yes, I can eat them all right.
Now, let's see if I can listen....  Yes, I can listen
all right."
</p>

<p>
"Then it's this.  I've been putting it off as long as
I can, but you've got to be told to-night.  It's&mdash;well&mdash;do
you know why you're here?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I do.  Haven't I just been showing you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, why are you here?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, frankly, because I'm hungry, I suppose.
Of course, I know that if I hadn't been I should have
come in to dinner, just the same, but&mdash;&mdash;  Hang it,
I mean that's the root idea of a dining-room, isn't
it?  And I am hungry.  At least I was."
</p>

<p>
"Stave it off again with an almond," said Myra,
pushing them along to me.  "What I really meant
was why you're here in the house."
</p>

<p>
This was much more difficult.  I began to consider
possible reasons.
</p>

<p>
"Because you all love me," I started; "because
you put the wrong address on the envelope; because
the regular boot-boy's ill; because you've never
heard me sing in church; because&mdash;stop me when
I'm getting warm&mdash;because Miss Fortescue refused
to come unless I was invited; because&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop," said Myra.  "That was it.  And, of
course, you know I didn't mean that at all."
</p>

<p>
"What an awful lot of things you don't mean to-night.
Be brave, and have it right out this time."
</p>

<p>
"All right, then, I will.  One, two, three&mdash;we're
going to act a play on Saturday."
</p>

<p>
She leant forward, and regarded me with apprehension.
</p>

<p>
"But why not?  I'll promise to clap."
</p>

<p>
"You can't, because, you see, you're going to act
too.  Isn't it jolly?" said Myra breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
I gave what, if I hadn't just begun the last sweet,
would have been a scornful laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Me act?  Why, I've never&mdash;I don't do it&mdash;it
isn't done&mdash;I don't act&mdash;not on Saturdays.  How
absurd!"
</p>

<p>
"Have you told him, Myra?" Dahlia called out
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm telling him now.  I think he's taking it all
right."
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk about me as 'him'!" I said angrily.
"And I'm not taking it all right.  I'm not taking it
at all."
</p>

<p>
"It's only such a very small part&mdash;we're all doing
something, you know.  And your costume's ordered
and everything.  But how awfully sporting of you."
</p>

<p>
After that, what could I say?
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;what am I?" I asked modestly.
</p>

<p>
"You're a&mdash;a small rat-catcher," said Myra cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon?"
</p>

<p>
"A rat-catcher."
</p>

<p>
"You said a small one.  Does that mean that I'm
of diminutive size, or that I'm in a small way of
business, or that my special line is young ones?"
</p>

<p>
"It means that you haven't much to say."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  And would you call it a tragic or a
pathetic part?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a comic part, rather.  You're Hereditary
Grand Rat-Catcher to the Emperor Bong.  Bong the
Second.  Not the first Bong, the Dinner Bong."
</p>

<p>
"Look here.  I suppose you know that I've never
acted in my life, and never been or seen a rat-catcher
in my life.  It is therefore useless for you to tell me
to be perfectly natural."
</p>

<p>
"You have so little to do; it will be quite easy.
Your great scene is where you approach the Emperor
very nervously&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I shall do the nervous part all right."
</p>

<p>
"And beg him to spare the life of his mother-in-law."
</p>

<p>
"Why?  I mean, who is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Fortescue."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I doubt if I can make that bit seem quite so
natural.  Still, I'll try."
</p>

<p>
"Hooray.  How splendid!"
</p>

<p>
"A rat-catcher," I murmured to myself.  "Where
is the rat?  The rat is on the mat.  The cat is on the
rat.  The bat is on the cat.  The&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr Derry will go through your part with you
to-morrow.  Some of it is funnier than that."
</p>

<p>
"The electrical engineer?  What do they know
about rat-catching?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, only&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Aha!  Now I see who your mysterious Mr Derry
is.  He is going to coach us."
</p>

<p>
"He is.  You've found it out at last.  How
bright green sweets make you."
</p>

<p>
"They have to be really bright green sweets.
Poor man!  What a job he'll have with us all."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Myra, as she prepared to leave me.
"Now you know why he doesn't get up till ten."
</p>

<p>
"In the rat-catching business," I said thoughtfully,
as I opened the door, "the real rush comes in
the afternoon.  Rat-catchers in consequence never
get up till ten-thirty.  Do you know," I decided, "I
am quite beginning to like my little part."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
ALARMS AND EXCURSIONS
</h3>

<p>
I was, I confess, very late the next morning,
even for a rat-catcher.  Mr Derry was in the
middle of his breakfast; all the others had finished.
We saluted, and I settled down to work.
</p>

<p>
"There is going to be a rehearsal at eleven o'clock,
I believe," said Derry.  "It must be nearly that
now."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be there," I said, "if I have to bring the
marmalade with me.  You're going to coach us?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I believe I said I would."
</p>

<p>
"Though I have never assumed the buskin myself,"
I went on, "I have, of course, heard of you as
an amateur actor." (<i>Liar</i>.) "And if you could tell
me how to act, while I am finishing my bacon, I
should be most awfully obliged."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you really done any?"
</p>

<p>
"Only once, when I was very small.  I was the
heroine.  I had an offer, but I had to refuse it, I
said, 'Alath, dear heart, I may not, I am married
already.'"
</p>

<p>
"Very right and proper," murmured Derry.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as it turned out, I had made a mistake.  It
was my first who had been married already.  The
little play was full of surprises like."
</p>

<p>
Derry coughed, and took out his pipe.  "Let me
see," he began, "what's your part?"
</p>

<p>
"I am&mdash;er&mdash;a rodent-collector."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes&mdash;the Emperor's rat-catcher."
</p>

<p>
"Grand hereditary," I said stiffly.  "It had been
in the family for years."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so."
</p>

<p>
I was about to enlarge upon the advantages of the
hereditary principle when the door opened suddenly
to admit Myra and Archie.
</p>

<p>
"You don't say you're down at last!" said Myra,
in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly say anything at breakfast, as a rule," I
pointed out.
</p>

<p>
"What an enormous one you're having.  And
only last night&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, I'm eating practically nothing&mdash;a
nut and one piece of parsley off the butter.  The fact
is, I glanced at my part before I went to bed, and
there seemed such a lot of it I hardly slept at all."
</p>

<p>
"Why, you don't come on very much," said Archie.
"Neither do I.  I'm a conjuror.  Can any gentleman
here oblige me with a rabbit? ... No, sir, I said a
rabbit.  Oh, I beg your pardon, I thought you were
coming up on to the stage....  Any gentleman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Have some jam instead.  What do you mean by
saying I don't come on very much?"  I took the book
out of my pocket, and began to turn the leaves.
"Here you are, nearly every page&mdash;'<i>Enter R.</i>,'
'<i>Exit R.</i>,' '<i>Enter L.</i>'&mdash;I don't know who <i>he</i> is&mdash;'<i>Exeunt
R.</i>,'&mdash;why, the rat-catcher's always doing
something.  Ah, here they're more explicit&mdash;'<i>Enter
R.C.</i>'  Hallo, that's funny, because I'd just&mdash;&mdash;  Oh,
I see."
</p>

<p>
"One of our oldest and most experienced mimes,"
said Archie to Derry.  "You must get him to talk to
you."
</p>

<p>
"No secret of the boards is hid from him," added
Myra.
</p>

<p>
"Tell us again, sir, about your early struggles,"
begged Archie.
</p>

<p>
"He means your early performances on the
stage," explained Myra.
</p>

<p>
"There's one very jolly story about Ellen Terry
and the fireproof curtain.  Let me see, were you
<i>Macbeth</i> then, or <i>Noise of Trumpets</i>?  I always
forget."
</p>

<p>
I drank my last cup of tea, and rose with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"It is a humorous family," I apologised to Derry.
"Their grandfather was just the same.  He <i>would</i>
have his little joke about the first steam-engine."
</p>

<p>
Outside, in the hall, there was a large crowd of
unemployed, all talking at once.  I caught the words
"ridiculous" and "rehearsal," and the connection
between the two seemed obvious and frequent.  I
singled out Thomas, abstracted his pouch, and began
to fill up.
</p>

<p>
"What is all this acting business?" I asked.
"Some idea about a little play, what?  Let's toddle
off, and have a game of billiards."
</p>

<p>
"They've let me in for a bally part," said Thomas,
"and you needn't think you're going to get out of it.
They've got you down, all right."
</p>

<p>
"Thomas, I will be frank with you.  I am no less
a person than the Emperor Bong's Hereditary (it
had been in the family for years) Grand Rat-catcher.
The real rush, however, comes in the afternoon.
My speciality is young ones."
</p>

<p>
"I'm his executioner."
</p>

<p>
"And he has a conjuror too.  What a staff!  Hallo,
good morning, Simpson.  Are you anything lofty?"
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, I am the Emperor Bong,'" said Simpson
gaily; "'I am beautiful, clever and strong&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"Question," said Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"''Tis my daily delight to carouse and to fight,
and at moments I burst into song.'"
</p>

<p>
I looked at him in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Well, just at present," I said, "all I want is
a match....  A lucifer, Emp.  A pine vesta, Maj.
Thanks....  Now tell me&mdash;does anybody beside
yourself burst into song during the play?  Any
bursting by Thomas or myself, for instance?"
</p>

<p>
"Nobody sings at all.  My little poem is
recitative."
</p>

<p>
"If you mean it's very bad, I agree with you,"
said Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"I made it up myself.  It was thought that my
part should be livened up a little."
</p>

<p>
"Well, why hasn't it been?"
</p>

<p>
"If you will give me two minutes, Simpson," I
said, "I will liven up my own part better than that.
What rhymes with rat-catcher?"
</p>

<p>
"Cat-catcher."
</p>

<p>
"Wait a bit....  Yes, that's got it.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Oh, I'm on the Emperor's staff<br>
  I'm a rodent-collector (don't laugh)&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My record (in braces)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rats and their races<br>
  Is a thousand and eight and a half.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"May we have that again?" said Myra, appearing
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, I'm on&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, I'm on&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Simpson.
</p>

<p>
"There is no real demand, I'm afraid."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I did just hear it before," said Myra.  "I
wish you'd make up one for me.  I think we might all
announce ourselves like that, and then the audience
will have no difficulty in recognising us."
</p>

<p>
"They'll recognise Thomas if he comes on with an
axe.  They won't think he's just trotted round with
the milk.  But what are you, Myra?"
</p>

<p>
"The Emperor's wife's maid."
</p>

<p>
"Another member of the highly trained staff.
Well, go on, Simpson."
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, I am her Majesty's maid,'" declared Simpson.
"We all begin with 'Oh,' to express surprise at
finding ourselves on the stage at all.  'Oh, I am her
Majesty's maid, I'm a sad little flirt, I'm afraid.'"
</p>

<p>
"I'm respectable, steady and staid," corrected Myra.
</p>

<p>
"No," I said; "I have it&mdash;"
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Oh, I am her Majesty's maid!<br>
  And her charms are beginning to fade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can sit in the sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look <i>just</i> twenty-one,<br>
  While <i>she's</i> thirty-six in the shade.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Myra made a graceful curtsey.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir.  You'll have to pay me a lot
more of those before the play is over."
</p>

<p>
"Will I really?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, seeing as the Grand Hereditary One is
supposed to be making up to her Majesty's
confidential attendant&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Miss Fortescue came pushing up to us.
</p>

<p>
"It is too ridiculous," she complained; "none of
us know our parts yet, and if we have a rehearsal
now&mdash;what do you think about it?"
</p>

<p>
I looked at Myra and smiled to myself.  "I'm all
for a rehearsal at once," I said.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
A REHEARSAL
</h3>

<p>
"Now this is a very simple trick," said Archie,
from the centre of the stage.  "For this
little trick all I want is, a hippopotamus and a couple
of rubies.  I take the hippopotamus in one hand&mdash;so&mdash;and
cover it with the handkerchief.  Then, having
carefully peeled the rubies&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Thomas put the last strip of silver paper on to his
axe, and surveyed the result proudly.
</p>

<p>
"But how splendid!" said Myra, as she hurried
past.  "Only you want some blood."  And she
jumped over the footlights and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"Good idea.  Archie, where do you keep the
blood?"
</p>

<p>
"Hey, presto! it's gone.  And now, sir, if you will
feel in your waistcoat pockets you will find the
hippopotamus in the right-hand side and the red
ink in the left.  No?  Dear, dear, the hippopotamus
must have been a bad one."
</p>

<p>
"Be an artist, Thomas," I said, "and open a vein
or two.  Do the thing properly, Beerbohm.  But
soft, a winsome maid, in sooth; I will approach her.
I always forget that sooth bit.  But soft, a win&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why don't we begin?" asked Simpson; "I
can't remember my part much longer.  Oh, by the
way, when you come up to me and say, 'Your
Majesty e'en forgets the story of the bull's-eye and
the revolving bookcase&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go away; I don't say anything so silly."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course it's Blair.  Blair, when you come
up to me and say&mdash;&mdash;"  They retired to the back of
the stage to arrange a very effective piece of business.
</p>

<p>
"Any card you like, madam, so long as it is in the
pack.  The Queen of Hearts?  Certainly.  Now I
take the others and tear them up&mdash;so.  The card
remaining will be yours.  Ah, as I thought&mdash;it is the
Queen of Hearts."
</p>

<p>
"Archie, you're talking too much," said Dahlia,
"and none of it comes into your part really."
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting the atmosphere.  Have you an old
top hat on you, dear, because if so we'll make a
pudding.  No top hat?  Then pudding is horf."
</p>

<p>
"But stay, who is this approaching?  Can it be&mdash;I
say, mind the footlights.  When are we going to
begin?"
</p>

<p>
"There!" said Thomas proudly.  "Anybody
would know that was blood."
</p>

<p>
"But how perfectly lovely," said Myra.  "Only
you want some notches."
</p>

<p>
"What for?"
</p>

<p>
"To show where you executed the other men, of
course.  You always get a bit off your axe when you
execute anybody."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I've noticed that too," I agreed.  "Notches,
Thomas, notches."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you do something for a change?
What about the trap or whatever it is you catch your
bally rats with?  Why don't you make that?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't done with a trap, Thomas dear.  It's
partly the power of the human eye and partly
kindness.  I sit upon a sunny bank and sing to them."
</p>

<p>
"Which is that?"
</p>

<p>
"If we don't begin soon," began Simpson&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Emperor, what's that you're saying?
Quite so, I agree with you.  I wonder if your High
Fatness can lend me such a thing as a hard-boiled
egg.  Simpkins, when this rehearsal is over&mdash;that is
to say, to-morrow&mdash;I'll take you on at juggling; I'm
the best&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Deny finished his conversation with Miss Fortescue
and turned to the stage.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, please, <i>please</i>," he said.  "We'll just
take the First Act.  Scene, The Emperor's Palace.
Enter Rat-catcher.  You come on from the left."
</p>

<p>
I coughed and came on.
</p>

<p>
My part was not a long one, but it was a very
important one.  I was the connecting link between the
different episodes of the play, and they wanted some
connecting.  Whenever anybody came on to the
stage, I said (supposing I was there, and I generally
was&mdash;the rat-catcher of those days corresponding
to the modern plumber)&mdash;I said, "But who is this?"
or "Hush, here comes somebody."  In this way, the
attention of the wakeful part of the audience was
switched on to the new character, and continuity of
action was preserved.
</p>

<p>
I coughed and came on.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Derry, "you must come on much more
briskly."
</p>

<p>
"I can't.  I've been bitten by a rat."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't say so anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's how I read the part.  Hang it, I
ought to know if I've been bitten or not.  But I
won't show it if you like; I'll come on briskly."
</p>

<p>
I went out, and came on very briskly.
</p>

<p>
"That's better," said Derry.
</p>

<p>
"'His Majesty ordered me to be here at the stroke
of noon,'" I said.  "'Belike he has some secret
commands to lay upon me, or perchance it is nought but
a plague of rats.  But who is this?'"
</p>

<p>
"'Oh,'" said Myra, coming in suddenly, "'I had
thought to be alone.'"
</p>

<p>
"'Nay, do not flee from me, pretty one.  It is thus
that&mdash;&mdash;' I say, Myra, it's no good my saying do
not flee if you don't flee."
</p>

<p>
"I was just going to.  You didn't give me a
chance.  There, now I'm fleeing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all right.  'It is thus that the rats flee when
they see me approaching.  Am I so very fearsome?'"
</p>

<p>
"'Orrid," said Archie to himself from the wings.
</p>

<p>
"One moment," said Derry, and he turned round
to speak to somebody.
</p>

<p>
"Puffickly 'orrid," said Archie again.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, do not frown," Myra went on, "'tis only my
little brother, who is like unto a codfish himself, and
jealous withal."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, and I thought it <i>was</i> a codfish.  So that I
had e'en brought the egg-sauce with me."
</p>

<p>
"Trouble not thyself for that," said Archie.  "For
verily the audience will supply thee with all the eggs
thou wantest.  I say, we <i>are</i> being funny."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not, I'm quite serious, I really did think it
was a co&mdash;&mdash;  'But tell me, fair one,'" I said
hurriedly, "'for what dost the Emperor want me?'"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," said Derry, "I'm sorry I had to
interrupt you.  I think perhaps we had better begin
again.  Yes, from the beginning."
</p>

<p>
The rehearsal rolled on.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"I think it went splendidly," said Myra.  "If
only we had known our parts and come in at the right
moments and been more serious over it."
</p>

<p>
"If there's any laughing to be done it will have to
be done by <i>us</i>.  The audience won't laugh."
</p>

<p>
"'Mr Derry having explained that the author was
not in the house, the audience collected their cauliflowers
and left quietly.'  I think it's a rotten play."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it isn't frightfully funny," said Myra, "but
we can put that in ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"It's so jolly hard to say the lines properly&mdash;they're
so unnatural," complained Thomas.  "'Truly
thou hast created a favourable impression with the
damsel'&mdash;well, I mean, it's absurd.  Any ordinary
person would say 'Truly thou art amongst them, old
spot,' or something of that kind."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you say that, Thomas; you'll be all right,"
</p>

<p>
"We might put a few songs in," said Dahlia,
"and a dance or two."
</p>

<p>
"I think you've forgotten that we've done only
Act I.," remarked Archie.  "His Majesty's conjuror
doesn't really let himself go till Act II.  Still, I'm
all for a song and a dance.  Simpson, come and
Apache with me."
</p>

<p>
They dashed at each other fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>we'll</i> make it go all right," said Myra.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
LAST MOMENTS
</h3>

<p>
"Has anybody here seen Kelly?" asked
Dahlia, putting her head in at the billiard-room
door.  "I mean Archie."
</p>

<p>
"I'm waiting here for Kate," I said.  "I mean Myra."
</p>

<p>
"Oughtn't you to be dressing?  It doesn't
matter about me&mdash;I'm not on for a long time."
</p>

<p>
"A rat-catcher's best suit is not an elaborate one;
I can put it on in about five minutes.  It is now
seven-thirty, we begin at eight-thirty&mdash;hence the
billiard cue.  More chalk."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why aren't you nervous?  How you can
stand calmly there&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am nervous.  Look."  I aimed carefully and
put the red into a pocket some miles away.  "There
you are.  Have you ever seen me do that in real life?
Of course not.  If my hand had been steady I should
have been a foot to the right.  Still more chalk."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I want Archie, and I shall cry if I don't find
him.  That's how I feel."  She sat down and got up
again.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Dahlia," I said solemnly, "now you can
understand a father's feelings&mdash;I mean, now, you see
what you women have brought on yourselves.  Who
suggested a play?  The women.  Who dragged me
into it?  The women.  Who said rat-catchers
always wore whiskers?  The women.  Who is
designing me a pair of whiskers at this moment?  The
wom&mdash;&mdash;Simpson.  Who but for whom (this is going
to be a very difficult sentence) who but for whom,
would be just thinking of dressing leisurely for dinner,
instead of which we had a hasty snack, and have now
got to put on heaven knows what?  The women.
Well, it serves you right."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be horrid.  I want Archie."  She got up
for the third time and drifted out of the room.
</p>

<p>
I chalked my cue and went into a pocket without
touching anything.  When I say I went in I mean
that the ball I was playing with went in.  You do
see that?  Very well, then.  I took it out and began
to squint along my cue again, when two hands came
suddenly over my eyes and a voice said; "Guess
who is is."
</p>

<p>
"The Queen of Sheba," I tried.
</p>

<p>
"Right," said Myra.
</p>

<p>
I turned and looked at her.
</p>

<p>
"Golly, you do, you really do!" I said at last.
"Did they always dress like that in the Bong era?
Short skirts, long pigtail, bare arms&mdash;lovely!"
</p>

<p>
"'I can sit in the sun and look just twenty-one,'"
sang Myra as she dropped into the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Well, just at present you're sitting in the
billiard-room and looking about fifteen....  How are you
getting on with your French this term?  I had a
very bad report in the holidays from your governess.
The extra ninepence a week seems to have been
simply thrown away."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you excited?" said Myra, looking at me
with sparkling eyes.
</p>

<p>
"As for calisthenics, well, what I say is, 'My
daughter is Church of England, and if you don't like
it, she can come away.  I'm not going to have her
stuffed up with all that nonsense.'"
</p>

<p>
Myra jumped up.  "Aren't you excited?" she
insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Feel my tongue&mdash;I mean my pulse, it's quite
normal.  And why?  Because I've forgotten my
part, and I'm going to bed."
</p>

<p>
"It's a great responsibility our beginning the play."
</p>

<p>
"It is.  Have you ever thought that, if we refused
to begin, the play couldn't continue, and then the
audience would be able to go home?  My idea was
to tackle the people as they arrive, and come to terms
with them.  I'm sure there's money in it."
</p>

<p>
"You aren't bothering, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I am.  I'd give a hundred pounds to
be out of it.  No, I wouldn't&mdash;I'd give a hundred
pounds if you'd always wear that frock and do your
hair like that.  Will you?  And you shall go on with
your French, child."
</p>

<p>
Myra curtsied prettily.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll go on with my whiskers.  You haven't
seen me in those yet, have you?"  There was a loud
noise without.  "Here they are, coming in."
</p>

<p>
It was not the whiskers, however, but Archie and
Thomas in full costume; Archie in green and Thomas
in black.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo," said Archie, "I feel just like a conjuror."
</p>

<p>
"You look just like a grasshopper," said Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"My dear friend," said Archie, patting him kindly
on his shoulder, "is that you?  But you oughtn't
to be here, you know.  You came up the hot-water
pipe, I suppose?  Yes, yes, but they misdirected
you&mdash;the blackbeetle department is in the basement.
Well, well, it will be easier going down."
</p>

<p>
"Archie, Dahlia's looking for you."
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, she found me.  She was nearly in
tears.  She said, 'Is that my Archibald or an onion?'  I
said 'Fear not, fair one, 'tis but the early crocus.'  Myra,
don't you think they've overdone the green
rather?  To be quite frank, I don't see why a
conjuror should be dressed in green at all."
</p>

<p>
"To distinguish him from the rat-catcher in brown,
the executioner in black, and the Master of the Gold
Fish in red."
</p>

<p>
"I had thought that perhaps a certain aptitude
for legerdemain might so distinguish him.  But I
perceive that I am wrong.  Hallo, why aren't you in
brown then?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming on like this," I explained.  "I was going
to have changed, but now I've seen you two, I
don't think I will.  With my ordinary clothes, one
whisker&mdash;probably the starboard one&mdash;and a little
insouciance, I shall be a great success."
</p>

<p>
"What annoys me," said Thomas, "is that in the
early Bong age they had no bally pockets.  I've
simply got nowhere to keep a handkerchief."
</p>

<p>
"Keep it behind the scenes; and then, if you blow
your nose immediately before the execution, and
again immediately after it, you ought to be all right."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't for that.  It's in case I want to cry."
</p>

<p>
"It's all right for me," said Archie.  "I've simply
got to say, 'Now can anybody in the audience oblige
me with a handkerchief?' and I shall get dozens."
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall probably touch you for one.  Great
Irvings! is this really Simpson?"
</p>

<p>
The Emperor Bong was making a splendid entry,
looking (except for his spectacles) exactly like an
emperor.
</p>

<p>
"Rise, rise," he said.  "Stop grovelling.  Oh,
look here, you fellows, when I say 'On the
stomach!' then you must&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I beg your pardon,
Miss Mannering, I didn't see you were there."
</p>

<p>
"Where are my whiskers?" I asked sternly.
</p>

<p>
"My dear old chap, I couldn't do them; there
wasn't enough to go round.  I made two nice little
eyebrows instead&mdash;you'll find them on your
dressing-table.  'Oh, I am the Emperor Bong, I am beautiful,
clever and strong.  I am beauti&mdash;&mdash;'  Do you think
I ought to wear my spectacles or not?"
</p>

<p>
There was a loud shout of "No!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all right.  But I shall probably fall over the
sunset or something.  Thomas, if you see me wandering
into a new moon, tap me on the head with your
axe.  Why isn't my rat-catcher dressed?"
</p>

<p>
"He was waiting for his whiskers."
</p>

<p>
"That's perfectly absurd.  You could have grown
a pair in the time.  Go and dress at once."
</p>

<p>
"I refuse to do anything till a quarter-past eight,"
I said.  "If I get into my things now, all the
atmosphere will have worn off by the time we begin."
</p>

<p>
"It's worn off me a long time ago," said Thomas
dismally.
</p>

<p>
"And me," said Myra, with a shiver.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we're all very miserable," said Archie;
"let's have a bottle of something.  What?  Oh,
hush!  Simpson, just ring the bell, and I'll show
you a little conjuring trick.  There's nothing on the
table at present, is there?  No.  Well, now, you
watch."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
THE NIGHT
</h3>

<p>
The play was a great success; I know, because
many of the audience told me so afterwards.
Had they but guessed what was going on behind the
scenes, the congratulations would have been even
more enthusiastic.  For as near as a touch we had to
drop the eggproof curtain and hand the money back.
</p>

<p>
I am going to give you the opening scene as it was
actually said&mdash;not as it was heard across the
footlights&mdash;and then you will understand.  As you may
remember, the <i>Rat-catcher</i> (Me) and the <i>Maid</i> (Myra)
take the stage first, and they introduce themselves
in the usual way to the audience and each other.
The scene is the palace of the <i>Emperor Bong</i> (Simpson).
Very well then.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>sweetly</i>).  Truly his Majesty is a handsome
man, and I wonder not that his people love him.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>rather nervous</i>).  Thou surprisest me.
I saw him in the wings&mdash;in the winter garden just
now&mdash;that is to say, anon&mdash;and thought him plain.
But hush, here he comes.
</p>

<p>
(<i>They salaam, or whatever you call it, and stay
there.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>still salaaming</i>).  What's the silly ass
waiting for?  I can't stick this much longer; the
blood's all going to my head like anything.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>in a similar position</i>).  He must have
forgotten his cue.  Can't you say, "Hush, here he
comes" again?
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i>.  I can't say anything out loud in this
position.  Do you think I might come up for a
breath?
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>loudly</i>).  His Majesty tarries.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>sotto voce</i>).  He does.  You've got it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i>.  Whatever shall we do?  Do think of
something.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i>.  Well, I'm going to rise to the surface.
I'm tired of being a submarine.  (<i>They both stand up</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>brilliantly</i>).  Perchance it was a rat we
heard and not his Majesty.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>with equal brilliance</i>).  Fear not, fair
damsel.  Behold, I will investigate.  (<i>Proceeds to
back of stage</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Archie</i> (<i>from wings</i>).  Come off, you idiot.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>always the gentleman&mdash;to Maid</i>).  Tarry
a while, my heart, what time I seek assistance.
(<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>confidentially to audience&mdash;to keep the thing
going</i>).  Truly he is a noble youth, though he follows
a lowly profession.  'Tis not the apparel that proclaims
the man.  Me thinks....
</p>

<p>
<i>Me</i> (<i>annoyed</i>).  Who's an idiot?
</p>

<p>
<i>Archie</i>.  Didn't you see me wink?  That ass
Simpson's banged his nose against a door-post and is
bleeding like a pig.  Says it's because he hadn't got
his spectacles.
</p>

<p>
<i>Me</i> (<i>still annoyed</i>).  More likely the champagne.
</p>

<p>
<i>Archie</i>.  They're dropping keys down his back as
hard as they can.  Will you and Myra gag a bit, till
he's ready?
</p>

<p>
<i>Me</i> (<i>excitedly</i>).  My good fool, how on earth&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Myra</i> (<i>coming to back of stage</i>).  But behold he
returns.  (<i>Frowns imperiously.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>coming on again very unwillingly</i>).  Ah,
fair maid, 'tis thee.  I bring thee good tidings.  I
met one in the ante-room, a long-legged, scurvy
fellow, who did tell me that his Majesty was delayed
on some business.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i>.  That must have been his Conjuror&mdash;I
know him well.  (<i>Aside.</i>) What's happened?
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i>.  Let us then rest a while, an it please
thee.  (<i>Seizing her by the arm.</i>) Over here.  That
ass Simpson's hurt himself.  We've got to amuse the
audience till he's finished bleeding.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>sitting down with her back to audience</i>).  I
say, is it really serious?
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i>.  Not for him; it is for us.  Now then,
talk away.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i>.  Er&mdash;h'm.  (<i>Coyly.</i>) Wilt not tell me of
thy early life, noble sir, how thou didst become a
catcher of rats?
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>disgusted</i>).  You coward!  (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Nay, rather let me hear of thine own life.  (<i>Aside.</i>)
Scored.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i>.  That's not fair.  I asked you first.
(<i>Modestly.</i>) But I am such a little thing, and you
are so noble a youth.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i>.  True.  (<i>Having a dash at it.</i>)  'Twas
thus.  My father, when I was yet a child, didst&mdash;did&mdash;no,
didst&mdash;apprentice me to a salad binger&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>with interest</i>).  How dost one bing salads?
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>curtly</i>).  Ballad singer.  And I would
frequent the market-place at noon, singing catches
and glees, and receiving from the entranced populace
divers coins, curses, bricks and other ornaments.
One morn, as I was embarked upon a lovely ballad,
"Place me amidst the young gazelles," I was seized right
suddenly from behind.  (<i>Bored to death.</i>)  I'm sick of
this.  We're supposed to be amusing the audience.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i>.  Oh, go on, I'm getting awfully amused.
</p>

<p>
<i>Emperor</i> (<i>audibly from green-room</i>).  Confound it,
it's begun again.
</p>

<p>
<i>Executioner</i> (<i>bitterly</i>).  And to think that I spent
hours putting red ink on my axe!
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>with great presence of mind</i>).  What's that?
Surely that was a rat.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>greatly relieved</i>).  It was.  (<i>Getting up.</i>)
Let's have Archie on, and see if he can amuse them
a bit more.  (<i>Aloud.</i>) I must finish my tale anon.
Stay here, sweet child, what time I fetch my trusty
terrier.  (<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i>.  'Tis a strange story he tells.  How
different from my own simple life.  Born of proud but
morbid parents....
</p>

<p>
<i>Archie</i>.  What's up?  Stick to it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Me</i>.  Have you got such a thing as a trusty terrier
on you?
</p>

<p>
<i>Archie</i> (<i>feeling up his sleeve</i>).  No.
</p>

<p>
<i>Me</i>.  Well, the audience will be extremely
disappointed if I don't bring one back.  I practically
promised them I would.  Look here, why don't you
come on and help?  Everybody is getting horribly
bored with us.
</p>

<p>
<i>Archie</i> (<i>delightedly</i>).  Oh, all right.
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Enter </i>Rat-catcher<i> and Conjuror</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i>.  But behold he returns <i>again</i>!
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>excitedly</i>).  Great news, fair lady, which
this long-legged, scurvy fellow I told you of will
impart to us.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i>.  Why, 'tis the Conjuror.  Have you news
for us, sir?
</p>

<p>
<i>Conjuror</i> (<i>with no illusions about the Oriental
style</i>).  Absolutely stop press.  What is it you want
to know?  Racing?  The Bong Selling Plate was
won by Proboscis, McSimp up.  Immense enthusiasm.
Bank rate unchanged&mdash;quite right this cold weather.
Excuse me a moment, sir, your moustache is coming
off.  No, the left wing&mdash;allow me to lend you a
postage stamp.  Do you prefer red or green?
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i> (<i>biting her lip</i>).  Will you not give us news of
the Emperor?
</p>

<p>
<i>Conjuror</i>.  I will.  His Majesty has met with a
severe accident whilst out hunting this morning,
being bitten by a buffalo.
</p>

<p>
<i>Maid</i>.  Alas, what will my mistress say?
</p>

<p>
<i>Conjuror</i>.  She has already said everything that
was necessary.  Her actual words were: "Just like
Bong."
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>seizing the opportunity</i>).  His Majesty
ordered me to meet him here at noon.  Methinks I
had better withdraw and return anon.  (<i>Makes off
hurriedly.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Conjuror</i> (<i>seizing him</i>).  Not so.  He bade me
command you to stay and sing to us.  (<i>Sensation.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>huskily</i>).  Alas, I have forgotten my
voice&mdash;that is, I have left my music at home.  I will
go and fetch it.  (<i>Has another dash.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Conjuror</i>.  Stay!  Listen!  (<i>They all listen.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Simpson</i> (<i>in wings</i>).  Thanks, thanks, that will be
all right now.  Oh no, quite, thanks.  Oh, is this
your key?  Thanks, thanks.  No, it doesn't matter
about the other ones, they don't feel at all
uncomfortable, thanks.  Yes, I think it really did stop it,
thanks.
</p>

<p>
<i>Conjuror</i>.  I'm off!  (<i>Aloud.</i>) His Majesty has
regained consciousness.  (<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<i>Simpson</i> (<i>apologetically</i>).  Oh, Archie, I've got the
billiard-room key in my&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Rat-catcher</i> (<i>very loudly to </i>Maid<i></i>).  Hush, here he
comes!  (<i>They salaam.</i>)
</p>

<p class="t3">
(<i>Enter the Emperor Bong.</i>)
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
THE CURTAIN GOES DOWN
</h3>

<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen," said Simpson at
the supper-table, glass in hand, "it is my
pleasant duty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bother!" murmured Myra.  "Drinking healths
always makes me feel funny."
</p>

<p>
"Silence for McSimp," shouted Archie.  "Now
then, pass along there, please.  There's no need to
push, you'll all be able to hear.  Gentlemen, the
O'Sumph is addressing us impromptu, not to say
unasked."
</p>

<p>
"It is my pleasant duty," continued Simpson,
"as your late Emperor (<i>Half-an-hour-late.  How's the
probosc?</i>), to propose the health of the Rabbits
Dramatic Company.  (<i>Hooray!</i>)  Great as we are
on the cricket-field (<i>Wide!</i>)&mdash;great, I say, as we are
on the cricket-field (<i>Pitch 'em up, Simpson</i>), we are,
I think, still greater in the halls of Thespis.  (<i>Don't
know the lady.</i>)  Gentlemen, I knew Irving.  (<i>Liar!</i>)
I have heard tell of Garrick (<i>Good!  Ever heard of
Shakespeare?</i>), but to-night has been a new experience
for me.  (<i>I will&mdash;give you&mdash;the kee&mdash;eys of&mdash;&mdash;.</i>)
Ladies and gentlemen, I propose our very good
healths, coupled with the name of our hostess
Miss Mannering."  (<i>Loud Cheers.</i>)
</p>

<p>
"That's me," said Myra.
</p>

<p>
"I single out Miss Mannering," added Simpson,
"because I'm sure we should all like to hear her make
a speech."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Samuel," said Myra, shaking her head at him,
"and I thought it was because you loved me."
</p>

<p>
"The Rabbits!  Myra!" we cried.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Mannering will now address you," announced
Archie.  "She will be glad to answer any questions
afterwards; but anyone who interrupts will be
hurled out.  I appeal to you, as Englishmen, to give
her a fair hearing."
</p>

<p>
Myra stood on a chair, looking lovely, but very
lonely, and waited till we were silent.
</p>

<p>
"My dear good friends," she began, and then she
caught Thomas's eye.  "Hallo, Tommy," she said
wistfully....  "My dear good friends, but why
should you say <i>I'm</i> a jolly good fellow, when it isn't
my birthday or anything?  But how <i>silly</i> of you!
Why, of course, we're <i>all</i> jolly good fellows&mdash;and jolly
good actors too.  It <i>has</i> been fun, hasn't it?  ...  Oh,
Archie, dear....  I hope we shall all be here in the
summer, don't you?  Well, you can't very well say
you don't, now I've asked you, can you?  You'll
have to pretend your uncles are very ill, and then
you needn't come....  Oh, <i>please&mdash;don't</i> look at me
like that, you make me want to cry, and I only want
to laugh to-night....  Archie, may I get down?"
</p>

<p>
"She <i>is</i> a dear," Dahlia whispered to me.  "How
you can go on&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
It was Simpson who saved the situation and made
us merry and bright again.  He hastily trotted out
the suggestion that we should tour the country in
the summer, playing cricket in the day and <i>Bong
the Second</i> at night.  Archie backed him up at
once.
</p>

<p>
"Only I'm off Bong Two altogether," he said.
"Of course, what we want is a cricket play.  We
shall have to write one ourselves, I expect; there
aren't any really good ones about.  Act I.  Rupert
Vavasour, a dashing bat and the last descendant of
an ancient but impoverished house, is in love with
the beautiful but equally impoverished Millicent.
Milly is being pursued by a rich villain of the name
of Jasper Fordyce, the said Jasper being a bowler
of extreme swiftness, with a qualification for
Essex....  Go on, Simpson."
</p>

<p>
"In order to restore the fallen fortunes of the
house, Rupert plays for Kent as a professional&mdash;Binks
(R.)&mdash;and secures talent money in six successive
matches.  Jasper hears of it, and (Act II.)
assassinates the scorer, bribing a hireling of his own
to take the deceased's place.  In the next match
Rupert only scores forty-nine."
</p>

<p>
"Rupert," continued Thomas, "who had been
counting his own jolly score, and made it eighty-seven,
was furious, and determined at all costs to foil
the villain.  Accordingly he went on to bowl in the
next innings and took five wickets for two hundred
and thirty-nine, thus obtaining talent money."
</p>

<p>
"A little love interest, please, Dahlia," said Archie.
</p>

<p>
"Now the captain, who was in the secret," said
Dahlia, "was in love with Rupert's sister, which
was why he put Binks (R.) on to bowl.  As soon as
Binks had collected his five wickets, Blythe went on,
and took the other five for three runs.  In this way
Kent just managed to win, and so Rupert got more
talent money."
</p>

<p>
"The next match was against Essex&mdash;Act III., the
great act of the play&mdash;and Jasper Fordyce was
playing for the Leyton brigade.  As he put on his
spurs before taking the field, and brushed his sleek
black hair, he smiled sardonically to himself.  Had
he not overnight dug holes in the pitch at the pavilion
end, and was not the wicket fiery, and he notoriously
an erratic bowler?"
</p>

<p>
"Everything points to Simpson playing Jasper,"
I said, and continued:
</p>

<p>
"'Heads,' cried Jasper.  It was heads.  'I put
you in,' he remarked calmly.  'What!' said the
other in amazement.  Ten minutes later Binks (R.)
and Humphreys were at the wicket.  Binks took
first ball with a touch of nervousness at his heart.
All depended on this match.  If only he could make
four hundred and fifty to-day, he would be able to
pay off the mortgage and marry his Millicent....
'Play.'  Jasper rushed up to the wicket and delivered
the ball.  Then before anybody could see how it
happened, Rupert was stretched full-length upon the
sward!"
</p>

<p>
"I had rather thought of playing Rupert myself,"
said Archie.  "But I'm not so sure now."
</p>

<p>
"Five for two hundred and thirty-nine," I
reminded him.  "The part was written for you."
</p>

<p>
"But what of Millicent?" said Myra.  "Fearing
lest some evil should overtake her lover she had
attended the match clad in a long ulster, and now
she flung this off, revealing the fact that she was in
flannels.  With her hair tucked up beneath her
county cap she looked a slim and handsome boy.  To
rush on to the field and take the injured one's place
was the work of a moment.  'Who is this?' said the
umpires in amazement.  'Fear not,' whispered
Millicent to Humphreys, 'I have a birth qualification
for the county, and the gardener coached me for an
hour last night.'"
</p>

<p>
"Once more Jasper rushed up to the crease, and
the spectators held their breath."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to be a spectator," I said, "with a
breath-holding part.  Sorry&mdash;go on, Blair."
</p>

<p>
"Then Millicent's bat flashed, and, behold! the
ball was on the boundary!  A torrent of cheers rent
the air.  Again he bowled, again the bat flashed.
Jasper ground his teeth."
</p>

<p>
"The curtain goes down here to represent the
passing of an hour.  When it rises again, Millicent's
score is four hundred and twenty-three.  There was
dead silence for a moment.  Then Millicent swung
her bat.  And at that the cheers broke out, such
cheering as had never been heard before.  Maclaren's
record score was beaten at last!  'Now surely he will
knock his wickets down,' said the spectators.  Little
did they know that until four hundred and fifty was
upon the tins the mortgage could not be paid off!
Four hundred and thirty&mdash;four hundred and forty&mdash;four
hundred and forty-nine&mdash;a sharply run single&mdash;four
hundred and fifty!  From the pavilion
Rupert heard the cheers and fainted again."
</p>

<p>
"It was 'over,' and Millicent had the bowling.
Jasper delivered the ball, a fast half-volley&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
("Oh, Simpson simply <i>must</i> play Jasper.")
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;and Millicent drove it back hard and true.
Jasper tried to duck, but it was too late.  He was
dead."
</p>

<p>
"Act IV.  All his money went to Rupert, who was
a distant cousin.  He married Millicent, and they
lived happily ever after.  But, though they are
always to be seen at the Tonbridge and Canterbury
weeks, they have never played cricket again.
<i>Curtain</i>."
</p>

<p>
"And bedtime," said Myra suddenly.  "Good-night,
everybody."
</p>

<h3>
MARGERY
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
TO MARGERY&mdash;FROM HER UNCLE
</p>

<p>
My dear Margery,&mdash;When I heard that you
really had arrived, I got out the broken tea-cup,
filled it at the bath, and drank "To my niece!"
with the greatest enthusiasm possible.  Had I been
on the stage I should then have hurled the cup over
my shoulder; and later on the scene-shifter would
have come and collected the bits.  As it was, I left
that part out; and you will forgive me, will you not,
dear baby, when you hear that it was your uncle's
last cup, and he in a bad way financially.
</p>

<p>
Personally I was all for coming to see you at once.
But you wrote that you would prefer me to postpone
my visit for a week; at the end of which time you
would have settled down, and I should be more in a
position to do you justice&mdash;the critic, rather than the
mere reporter.  I don't know if those were quite
your words, but that at any rate was the idea.  So,
baby, here I am&mdash;a week later, and just returned
from seeing you.  What, you wish to know, were my
impressions?
</p>

<p>
It is like your cool way, asking me what I think of
you.  It was you who were to have been interviewed
by <i>me</i>.  You were a stranger, one short week on our
shores; and I wanted to ask you what you thought
of the English ladies, what were your views on our
climate and (above all) what was your opinion of the
English press.  My editor had heard of your landing,
and those were the things he wished to know.  Well,
I shall say that your views were undecided.  Two
kicks, a cry, and something very like a sneeze&mdash;you
haven't quite got the hang of our language yet.
</p>

<p>
You know, Margery, there was at one time some
talk of your being a boy; and, in that case, your
father and I had decided that you were to play for
Kent.  I was to have bowled to you every evening,
and he would have stood by and said, "You should
have come forward to that one, sir."  At the public
schools they call this "coaching."  However, that
dream is over now, and the most we can hope for is
that you should marry someone in the eleven.  Your
father and I were discussing it last night (in front of
you&mdash;oh, what would Mrs Grundy say?), and we had
almost fixed on Woolley; but your mother objected
because he was a professional.  A trivial reason, dear
Margery, but you know what women are.  You gave
a little cry just at that moment, and I know you
meant, "Well, why not Mr Hutchings then?"  Well,
we had thought of him, only your mother says he will
be too old.  I do hope, baby, that when you grow
up you will be guided by what your heart says, and
not by what your mother says....
</p>

<p>
Your mother&mdash;I think you must be careful in your
dealings with that woman.  Above all, do not let
her prejudice you against your uncle.  At one time
yesterday we were discussing your personal features.
"Her grannie's mouth," said somebody; "her father's
nose," volunteered another.  "Look at the darling's
eyes, just like her loving mummy's," was that
shameless person's own contribution.  Then I in
haste, "But, I say, what about her uncle?"
</p>

<p>
Margery, your mother looked at you thoughtfully.
She looked at you every way.  And then suddenly, in
triumph, she cried, "Why, nurse!  Of course!  Her
uncle's hair!"
</p>

<p>
They tell me, Margery, that as a matter of fact your
name is Marjorie; and they say that the other
reminds them too much of Margarine.  That just
shows how ignorant they are.  I looked up "margarine,"
in the dictionary, and it is called so because
of its "pearly lustre."  If that isn't good enough for
them, they must be a very proud couple.  Anyhow,
you are Margery to me: I hope I have a mind above
your commonplace Marjories.
</p>

<p>
There are many things that I have to say to you,
but I feel quite sure that your mother reads your
letters; so perhaps I had better wait till I can see
you alone.  I want you always to insist on wearing
shoes, as a little girl, and not those ghastly
thirty-nine-button boots; also on going to one of the very big
schools if you go to a boarding school at all.  And I
want&mdash;but I must talk to your father about it.  I like
to think he is still my ally.  Time was when he too
knew all about the bringing up of children, and though
he has handicapped himself by marrying, yet now
and then, when we are alone together, he is almost
sensible on the subject.
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.  Give my love to your mother.  Perhaps
we can trust her more than we thought, after
all.  Ever your loving UNCLE
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
TO HER UNCLE&mdash;FROM MARGERY
</p>

<p>
My dear Uncle,&mdash;Thank you for your letter.  I was
just as glad when they told me about <i>you</i>!  And I
said to myself, "I must be very nice to him, because
mother and I have been here for years and years
simply, and he's quite new."  And it's unkind of you
to say I kicked, I was only stretching, and one must
stretch or one will never grow.  I heard nurse tell
mother that, and you <i>know</i> you'd like to have a tall
niece.
</p>

<p>
I think I shall like you, if you're sure you won't
mind my being only a girl.  I don't think father
minds, although he looks very sad about something
every now and then.  He came back late from the
office the other day, and mother told me he'd done
such a lot of work, and was so tired, and I cried all
night about it, I was so sorry for him.
</p>

<p>
Mother <i>is</i> a funny person.  This morning I did my
trick of opening one eye and keeping the other shut,
and she got fearfully excited, and called out "Nurse,
nurse, what's the matter with baby, she can't open
one of her eyes!"  And then I simply <i>had</i> to open
it, so as I could wink at nurse to show her what a silly
mother we had.  But I have given up my other joke,
of pretending to be dead.  I used to do it every night,
and she would creep out of bed, and come and listen
at my cradle, and....  Well, I'm only a girl, and I
shall never go to a public school, but still I know when
a joke ceases to be a joke and becomes bad form.  So
I have given it up.
</p>

<p>
Oh, talking of bad form, some chemists who had
read about me in the papers sent me a sample of
<i>tooth</i> powder.  In rather doubtful taste, I thought....
</p>

<p>
I want you to come and see me have my bath.
Mother asks all her friends, so why shouldn't I ask
mine?  Of course, I would rather keep it private,
but if mother is going to make a show of it we may
as well have the right people there.  Do you know,
uncle, they actually do it in a <i>basin</i>, although
there's a proper bath just next door!  I know I'm
small, but is it quite fair always to be harping on the
fact?  (Twice a day, if you will believe me.)  Of
course, mother and nurse are only women, and they
wouldn't understand this.  But I am sure you,
uncle, would be more careful of people's feelings.
</p>

<p>
I am sorry, dear, but I don't think I shall be able
to marry either Mr Hutchings or Mr Woolley; you
see they <i>are</i> rather old for me, <i>aren't</i> they?  Mother
told me yesterday that there is a dear little boy of four
or five playing about somewhere, who will come for
me one day and take me right away from her and
father.  <i>Fancy</i>!  What fun!
</p>

<p>
About my name.  Well, I'm afraid it will have to
be <i>Marjorie</i> after all.  Of course, I should prefer it to
be <i>Margery</i>, but mother assures me that the owner
of the name is <i>never</i> consulted, so I can't say
anything.  But I will always be Margery to you,
and we won't say anything more about it to the
others.  Do you see, dear?
</p>

<p>
And now I must say good-bye, as mother says I
want to go to sleep.  She is writing this for me, and
some of the things she didn't want to say at all, but
I threatened her with my joke, and then she did.
But we both send our love.  Your affectionate
niece, MARGERY
</p>

<p>
P.S. 1.&mdash;I was weighed yesterday.  I weigh quite
a lot of pounds.
</p>

<p>
P.S. 2.&mdash;Come to-morrow at four, and I will show
you my toes.

<h3>
MARGERY'S SOCK
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER I
</p>

<p>
When Margery was three months old I wrote
a letter to her mother:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR MADAM,&mdash;If you have a copy in Class D
at 1s. 10d. net, I shall be glad to hear from you.  I
am, THE BABY'S UNCLE"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
On Tuesday I got an answer by the morning post:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR SIR,&mdash;In reply to yours: How dare you
insult my child?  She is in Class A1, priceless, and
bought in by the owner.  Four months old and two
days on Christmas Day.  Fancy!  I am,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"THE BABY'S MOTHER"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Margery had been getting into an expensive way
of celebrating her birthday every week.  Hitherto
I had ignored it.  But now I wrote:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR MADAM,&mdash;Automatically your baby should
be in Class D by now.  I cannot understand why it is
not so.  Perhaps I shall hear from you later on with
regard to this.  Meanwhile I think that the extraordinary
coincidence (all but two days) of the baby's
birthday with Christmas Day calls for some recognition
on my part.  What would Margery like?  You,
who are in constant communication with her, should
be able to tell me.  I hear coral necklaces well spoken
of.  What do you think?  I remember reading once
of a robber who 'killed a little baby for the coral on
its neck'&mdash;which shows at any rate that they are
worn.  Do you know how coral reefs are made?
It is a most fascinating business.
</p>

<p>
"Then there is a silver mug to be considered.  The
only thing you can drink out of a mug is beer; yet
it is a popular present.  Perhaps you, with your
(supposed) greater knowledge of babies, will explain
this.  Meanwhile I am,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"THE BABY'S UNCLE"
</p>

<p>
"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Which is a much finer thing than a
mother."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
To which her mother:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"MY DEAR BOY,&mdash;It is too sweet of you to say
you would like to get baby something.  No, I don't
know how coral reefs are made, and I don't want to.
I think it is wicked of you to talk like that; I'm sure
I sha'n't dare to let her wear anything valuable now.
And I don't think she really wants a mug.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I don't know what she does want,
except to see her uncle (There!), but it ought to be
something that she'll value when she grows up.  And
of course we could keep it for her in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
"Her father has smoked his last cigar to-day.
Isn't it awful?  I have forbidden him to waste his
money on any more, but he says he <i>must</i> give me five
hundred for a Christmas present.  If he does, I shall
give him that sideboard that I want so badly, and then
we shall both go to prison together.  You will look
after baby, won't you?  I am,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"THE BABY'S MOTHER"
</p>

<p>
"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Which she isn't proud, but does think it's
a little bit classier than an uncle."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And so, finally, I;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR CHILD,&mdash;I've thought of the very thing.
I am, THE BABY'S UNCLE"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That ends Chapter I.  Here we go on to
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER II
</p>

<p>
Chapter II finds me in the toy department of the
Stores.
</p>

<p>
"I want," I said, "a present for a child."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  About how old?"
</p>

<p>
"It must be quite new," I said sternly.  "Don't
be silly.  Oh, I see.  Well, the child is only a baby."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes.  Now here&mdash;if it's at all fond of
animals&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I say, you mustn't call it 'IT.'  <i>I</i> get in an awful
row if <i>I</i> do.  Of course, I suppose it's all right for
you, only&mdash;well, be careful, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
The attendant promised, and asked whether the
child was a boy or a girl.
</p>

<p>
"And had you thought of anything for the little
girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes.  I had rather thought of a sideboard."
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon?"
</p>

<p>
"A sideboard."
</p>

<p>
"The Sideboard Department is upstairs.  Was
there anything else for the little girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, a box of cigars.  Rather full, and if you
have any&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The Cigar Department is on the ground floor."
</p>

<p>
"But your Lord Chamberlain told me I was to
come here if I wanted a present for a child."
</p>

<p>
"If you require anything in the toy line&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but what good are toys to a baby of four
months?  Do be reasonable."
</p>

<p>
"What was it <i>you</i> suggested?  A sideboard and a
cigar?"
</p>

<p>
"That was my idea.  It may not be the best
possible, but at least it is better than perfectly
useless toys.  You can always blow smoke in its face,
or bump its head against the sideboard.  <i>Experto
crede</i>, if you have the Latin."
</p>

<p>
Whereupon with great dignity I made my way to
the lift.
</p>

<p>
In the Sideboard Department I said: "I want a
sideboard for a little girl of four months, and please
don't call her 'IT.'  I nearly had a row with one of
your downstairs staff about that."
</p>

<p>
"I will try to be careful, sir," he replied.  "What
sort of a one?"
</p>

<p>
"Blue eyes, and not much hair, and really rather
a sweet smile....  Was that what you wanted to
know?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir.  But I meant what sort of a
sideboard?"
</p>

<p>
I took him confidentially by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," I said, "you know how, when one
is carrying a baby about, one bumps its head on all
the corners?  Well, not too much of that.  The
mothers don't really like it, you know.  They smile
at the time, but ...  Well, not too many corners....
Yes, I like that very much.  No, I won't take
it with me."
</p>

<p>
The attendant wrote out the bill.
</p>

<p>
"Number, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"She's the first.  That's why I'm so nervous.
I've never bought a sideboard for a child before."
</p>

<p>
"Your Stores number, I mean, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't got one.  Is it necessary?"
</p>

<p>
"Must have a number, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll think of a nice one for you....  Let's
see&mdash;12345, now does that strike you?"
</p>

<p>
"And the name?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't tell you that.  You must look that
up for yourself.  Good-day."
</p>

<p>
Downstairs I bought some cigars.
</p>

<p>
"For a little girl of four months," I said, "and she
likes them rather full.  Please don't argue with me.
All your men chatter so."
</p>

<p>
"I must," said the attendant.  "It's like this.
If she is only four months, she is obviously little.
Your observation is therefore tautological."
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact," I said hotly, "she is rather
big for four months."
</p>

<p>
"Then it was a lie."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, you give me those cigars, and don't
talk so much.  I've already had words with your
Master of the Sideboards and your Under-Secretary
for the Toy Department....  Thank you.  If you
would kindly send them."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER III
</p>

<p>
So there it is.  I have given the spirit, rather than
the actual letter, of what happened at the Stores.
But that the things have been ordered there is no
doubt.  And when Margery wakes up on Christmas
Day to find a sideboard and a box of cigars in her
sock I hope she will remember that she has chiefly
her mother to thank for it.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
HOW TO PLAY THE PIANOLA
</h3>

<p>
(FOREWORD.&mdash;Margery wishes me to publish the following
correspondence, which has recently passed between us.
It occurs to me that the name under which I appear in it
may perhaps need explanation.  I hate explanations, but
here it is.
</p>

<p>
When Margery was eight months old she was taught to
call me "Uncle."  I must suppose that at this time I was
always giving her things&mdash;things she really wanted, such
as bootlaces, the best china, evening papers, and so
on&mdash;which had been withheld by those in authority.  Later on
these persons came round to my way of thinking, and gave
her&mdash;if not the best china, at any rate cake and bread-and-butter.
Naturally, their offerings, being appreciated at last,
were greeted with the familiar cry of "Uncle."  "No, dear,
not 'Uncle,'&mdash;'Thank-you'" came the correction.)
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
DEAR THANKYOU,&mdash;I've some wonderful news
for you!  Guess what it is, but no, you
never will.  Well, I'll tell you.  <i>I can walk!</i>  Really
and really.
</p>

<p>
It is most awfully interesting.  You put one foot
out to the right, and then you bring the left after it.
That's one walk, and I have done seven altogether.
You have to keep your hands out in front of you, so
as to balance properly.  That's all the rules&mdash;the
rest is just knack.  I got it quite suddenly yesterday.
It is such fun; I wake up about five every morning
now, thinking of it.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I fall down now and then.  You see,
I'm only beginning.  When I fall, mother comes and
picks me up.  That reminds me.  I don't want you to
call me "baby" any more, now I can walk.  Babies
can't walk, they just get carried about and put in
perambulators.  I was given a lot of names a long
time ago, but I forget what they were.  I think one
was something rather silly, like Margery, but I have
never had it used lately.  Mother always calls me
O.D. now.
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.  Write directly you get this.  Your
loving O.D.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
MY DEAR O.D.,&mdash;I was so glad to get your letter,
because I was just going to write to you.  What do
you think?  No, you'll never guess&mdash;shall I tell
you?&mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;no; well, I've bought a pianola!
</p>

<p>
It's really rather difficult to play it properly.  I
know people like Paderewski and&mdash;I can only think
of Paderewski for the moment&mdash;I know that sort of
person doesn't think much of the pianola artist; but
they are quite wrong about it all.  The mechanical
agility with the fingers is nothing, the soul is
everything.  Now you can get the soul, the <i>con molto
expressione</i> feeling, just as well in the pianola as in the
piano.  Of course you have to keep a sharp eye on
the music.  Some people roll it off just like a
barrel-organ; but when I see <i>Allegro</i> or <i>Andante</i> or anything
of that kind on the score, I'm on it like a bird.
</p>

<p>
No time for more now, as I've just got a new lot of
music in.  Your loving THANKYOU
</p>

<p>
P.S.&mdash;When are you coming to hear me play?  I
did "Mumbling Mose" just now, with one hand and
lots of soul.  (Signed) PADEREWSKI
</p>

<p>
P.P.S.&mdash;I am glad you can walk.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
DEAR THANKYOU,&mdash;I am rather upset about my
walking.  You remember I told you I had done
seven in my last?  Well, this morning I couldn't
do a single one!  Well, I did do one, as a matter of
fact, but I suppose some people would say it didn't
count, because I fell down directly after, though I
don't see that that matters&mdash;do you, Thankyou?
But even with that one it was only one, and yet I
know I did seven the day before.  I wonder why it is.
I do it the right way, I'm sure, and I keep my hands
out so as to balance, so perhaps it's the shoes that
are wrong.  I must ask mother to get me a new pair,
and tell the man they're for walks.
</p>

<p>
Now <i>do</i> write me a nice long letter, Thankyou,
because I feel very miserable about this.  It <i>is</i> right,
isn't it, when you have the right leg out, only to
bring the left one just up to it, and not beyond?
And does it matter which foot you start with?  Let
me know quickly, because father is coming home
to-morrow and I want to show him.  Your loving
</p>

<p class="noindent">
O.D.
</p>

<p>
P.S.&mdash;I am glad you like your pianola.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
DEAR O.D.,&mdash;Very glad to get yours.  If you really
want a long letter, you shall have one; only I warn
you that, if once I begin, nothing less than an
earthquake can stop me.  Well, first then, I played the
"Merry Widow Waltz" yesterday to Mrs Polacca,
who is a great authority on music, and in with all
the Queen's Hall set, and she said that my touch
reminded her of&mdash;I've forgotten the man's name now,
which is rather sickening, because it spoils the story
a bit, but he was one of the real tip-toppers who
make hundreds a week, and, well&mdash;that was the
sort of man I reminded her of.  If I can do that with
a waltz, it stands to reason that with something
classic there'd be no holding me.  I think I shall
give a recital.  Tickets 10s. 6d.  No free seats.  No
emergency exit.  It is a great mistake to have an
emergency exit at a recital....
</p>

<p class="t3">
(<i>Three pages omitted.</i>)
</p>

<p>
Really, O.D., you must hear me doing the double
F in the "Boston Cake Walk" to get me at my best.
You've heard Kubelik on the violin?  Well, it's not
a bit like that, and yet there's just that something
which links great artists together, no matter what
their medium of expression.  Your loving
</p>

<p class="noindent">

<p>
<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Glad you're getting on so well with your
walking.

</p>

<p>
DEAREST THANKYOU,&mdash;Hooray, hooray, hooray&mdash;I
did twenty-five walks to-day!  Father counted.
He says my style reminds him of <i>Cancer Vulgaris</i>
rather.  How many times can <i>he</i> do it?  Not
twenty-five on the third day, I'm sure.
</p>

<p>
Isn't it splendid of me?  I see now where I was
wrong yesterday.  I got the knack again suddenly
this morning, and I'm all right now.  To-morrow,
I shall walk round the table.  It is a longish way, and
there are four turns, which I am not sure about.  How
<i>do</i> you turn?  I suppose you put the right hand
out?  Your very loving O.D.

</p>

<p>
DEAR O.D.,&mdash;I am rather hurt by your letters.  I
have written several times to tell you all about my
new pianola, and you don't seem to take any interest
at all.  I was going to have told you this time that
the man in the flat below has sent me a note, just as
if it had been a real piano.  He says he doesn't mind
my playing all day, so long as I don't start before
eight in the morning, as he is in his bath then, and
in listening to the music quite forgets to come out
sometimes, which, I can see, might be very awkward.
Write to yours affectionately, THANKYOU

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
DARLING THANKYOU,&mdash;I am so sorry, dear, and I
will come and hear your pianola to-morrow, and I
think it lovely, and you must be clever to play so well;
but you mustn't be angry with me because I am so
taken up with my walking.  You see, it is all so new
to me.  I feel as though I want everybody to know
all about it.
</p>

<p>
Your pianola must be lovely, Thankyou.  <i>Dear</i>
Thankyou, could you, do you think, put all the
letters we wrote to each other about my walking in
some book, so that other people would know how to
do it the way I do?  You might call it "Letters on
Walking," or "How to Walk," or&mdash;but you could get
a better title than I could.  <i>Do!</i>  Your very loving
O.D.
</p>

<p>
P.S.&mdash;I'm so glad about the pianola, and do you
mind if I just tell you that I <i>did</i> walk round the table,
corners and all?

<h3>
THE KNIGHT OF THE CHIMNEY-PIECE
</h3>

<p>
We don't know his real name, but we have
decided to call him Arthur.  ("Sir Arthur,"
I suppose he would be.)  He stands in bronze upon
the chimney-piece, and in his right hand is a javelin;
this makes him a very dangerous person.  Opposite
him, but behind the clock (Coward!), stands the
other fellow, similarly armed.  Most people imagine
that the two are fighting for the hand of the lady on
the clock, and they aver that they can hear her heart
beating with the excitement of it; but, to let you
into the secret, the other fellow doesn't come into
the story at all.  Only Margery and I know the true
story.  I think I told it to her one night when she
wouldn't go to sleep&mdash;or perhaps she told it to me.
</p>

<p>
The best of this tale (I say it as the possible author)
is that it is modern.  It were easy to have invented
something more in keeping with the knight's armour,
but we had to remember that this was the twentieth
century, and that here in this twentieth century was
Sir Arthur on the chimney-piece, with his javelin
drawn back.  For whom is he waiting?
</p>

<p>
"It all began," I said, "a year ago, when Sir
Arthur became a member of the South African
Chartered Incorporated Co-operative Stores Society
Limited, Ten per cents at Par (Men only).  He
wasn't exactly a real member, having been elected
under Rule Two for meritorious performances, Rule
One being that this club shall be called what I said
just now; but for nearly a year he enjoyed all the
privileges of membership, including those of paying a
large entrance fee and a still larger subscription.  At
the end of a year, however, a dreadful thing
happened.  They made a Third Rule&mdash;to wit, that
no member should go to sleep on the billiard-table.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Sir Arthur, having only got in under
Rule Two, had to resign.  He had already paid his
large entrance fee, and (as it happened) his second
year's subscription in advance.  Naturally, he was
annoyed....
</p>

<p>
"And that, in fact, is why he stands on the
chimney-piece with his javelin drawn back.  He is
waiting for the secretary.  Sir Arthur is considered
to be a good shot, and the secretary wants all the
flowers to be white."
</p>

<p>
At this point, Margery said her best word,
"Gorky," which means "A thousand thanks for the
verisimilitude of your charming and interesting story,
but is not the love element a trifle weak?" (Margery
is a true woman.)
</p>

<p>
"We must leave <i>something</i> to the imagination," I
pleaded.  "The secretary no doubt had a delightful
niece, and Sir Arthur's hopeless passion for her, after
he had hit her uncle in a vital spot, would be the basis
of a most powerful situation."
</p>

<p>
Margery said "Gorky," again, which, as I have
explained, means, "Are such distressing situations
within the province of the Highest Art?"
</p>

<p>
When Margery says "Gorky" twice in one night
it is useless to argue.  I gave in at once.  "Butter,"
I said, "placed upon the haft of the javelin would
make it slip, and put him off his shot.  He would miss
the secretary and marry the niece."  So we put a
good deal of butter on Sir Arthur, and for the
moment the secretary is safe.  I don't know if we
shall be able to keep it there; but in case jam does
as well, Margery has promised to stroke him every
day.
</p>

<p>
However, I anticipate.  As soon as the secretarial
life was saved, Margery said "Agga," which is, as it
were, "<i>Encore!</i>" or "<i>Bis!</i>" so that I have her
permission to tell you that story all over again.
Indeed, I should feel quite justified in doing so.
Instead I will give you the tragedy of George, the
other fellow (no knight he), as she told it to me
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"George was quite a different man from Sir Arthur.
So far from being elected to anything under Rule Two,
he got blackballed for the St John's Wood Toilet Club.
Opinions differed as to why this happened; some said
it was his personal unpopularity (he had previously
been up, without success, for membership of the local
Ratepayers Association); others (among them the
proprietor), that his hair grew too quickly.
Anyhow, it was a great shock to George, and they had
to have a man in to break it to him.  (It's always the
way when you have a man in.)
</p>

<p>
"George was stricken to the heart.  This last
blow was too much for what had always been a
proud nature.  He decided to emigrate.  Accordingly
he left home, and moved to Kilburn.  Whether
he is still there or not I cannot say; but a card with
that postmark reached his niece only this week.  It
was unsigned, and bore on the space reserved for
inland communications these words: <i>The old old
wish&mdash;A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"But what about the javelin?" I asked Margery.
(This fellow had a javelin too, you remember.)
</p>

<p>
"<i>Gorky</i>," said Margery, for the third time which
means&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Well, upon my word, I don't know what it means.
But it would explain it all.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Sir Arthur (he was in my story, you
know) is still waiting for the secretary.  In case the
butter gives out, have I mentioned that the secretary
wants all the flowers to be white?

<h3>
THE ART OF CONVERSATION
</h3>

<p>
"In conversation," said somebody (I think it was
my grandfather), "there should always be a<br>
give and take.  The ball must be kept rolling."  If
he had ever had a niece two years old, I don't think
he would have bothered.
</p>

<p>
"What's 'at?" said Margery, pointing suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"That," I said, stroking it, "is dear uncle's
nose."
</p>

<p>
"What's 'at?"
</p>

<p>
"Take your finger away.  Ah, yes, that is dear
uncle's eye.  The left one."
</p>

<p>
"Dear uncle's left one," said Margery thoughtfully.
"What's it doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Thinking."
</p>

<p>
"What's finking?"
</p>

<p>
"What dear uncle does every afternoon after
lunch."
</p>

<p>
"What's lunch?"
</p>

<p>
"Eggs, sardines, macaroons&mdash;everything."
</p>

<p>
With a great effort Margery resisted the temptation
to ask what "everything" was (a difficult question),
or what everything was doing (a still more difficult
one), and made a statement of her own.
</p>

<p>
"Santa Claus bring Margie a balloon from daddy,"
she announced.
</p>

<p>
"A balloon!  How jolly!" I said with interest.
"What sort are you having?  One of those semi-detached
ones with the gas laid on, or the pink ones
with a velvet collar?"
</p>

<p>
"Down chimney," said Margery.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>that</i> kind.  Do you think&mdash;I mean, isn't it
rather&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tell Margie a story about a balloon."
</p>

<p>
"Bother," I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"What's bovver?"
</p>

<p>
"Bother is what you say when relations ask you
to tell them a story about a balloon.  It means,
'But for the fact that we both have the
Montmorency blood in our veins, I should be compelled
to decline your kind invitation, all the stories I
know about balloons being stiff 'uns.'  It also means,
'Instead of talking about balloons, won't you sing
me a little song?'"
</p>

<p>
"Nope," said Margery.
</p>

<p>
"Bother, she's forgotten her music."
</p>

<p>
"What did you say, uncle dear, what did you say?"
</p>

<p>
I sighed and began.
</p>

<p>
"Once upon a time there was a balloon, a dear
little toy balloon, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's 'at?" asked Margery, making a dab at
my chest.  "What's 'at, uncle dear?"
</p>

<p>
"That," I said, "is a button.  More particularly,
a red waistcoat button.  More particularly still, my
top red waistcoat button."
</p>

<p>
"What's <i>'at</i>?" she asked, going down one.
</p>

<p>
"That is a button.  <i>Description</i>: second, red,
waistcoat.  <i>Parents living</i>: both.  <i>Injections diseases</i>:
scarlet fever slightly once."
</p>

<p>
"What's <i>'at</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"That's a&mdash;ah, yes, a button.  The third.  A
good little chap, but not so chubby as his brothers.
He couldn't go down to Margate with them last year,
and so, of course&mdash;&mdash;  Well, as I was saying, there
was once a balloon, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's 'a-a-at?" said Margery, bending forward
suddenly and kissing it.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, you've jolly well got to enclose a
stamped addressed envelope with the next question.
As a matter of fact, though you won't believe me,
that again is a button."
</p>

<p>
"What's 'at?" asked Margery, digging at the
fifth button.
</p>

<p>
"Owing to extreme pressure on space," I
began....  "Thank you.  That also is a button.
Its responsibility is greater than that of its brethren.
The crash may come at any moment.  Luckily it
has booked its passage to the&mdash;&mdash;  Where was I?
Oh yes&mdash;well, this balloon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's 'at?" said Margery, pointing to the last one.
</p>

<p>
"I must have written notice of that question.  I
can't tell you offhand."
</p>

<p>
"What's 'at, uncle dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know, Margie.  It looks something
like a collar stud, only somehow you wouldn't expect
to find a collar-stud there.  Of course it may have
slipped....  Or could it be one of those red beads,
do you think?  N-no, no, it isn't a bead....  And it
isn't a raspberry; because this is the wrong week for
raspberries.  Of course it might be a&mdash;&mdash;  By Jove,
I've got it!  It's a button!"
</p>

<p>
I gave the sort of war-whoop with which one announces
these discoveries, and Margery whooped too.
</p>

<p>
"A button!" she cried.  "A dear little button!"  She
thought for a moment.  "What's a button?"
</p>

<p>
This was ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean to say," I reproached her,
"that I've got to tell you now what a button is?
<i>That</i>," I added severely, pointing to the top of my
waistcoat, "is a button."
</p>

<p>
"What's 'at?" said Margery, pointing to the next one.
</p>

<p>
I looked at her in horror.  Then I began to talk
very quickly.
</p>

<p>
"There was once a balloon," I said rapidly, "a
dear little boy balloon, I mean toy balloon, and this
balloon was a jolly little balloon just two minutes
old, and he wasn't always asking silly questions, and
when he fell down and exploded himself they used to
wring him out and say, 'Come, come, now, be a
little airship about it,' and so&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's 'at?" asked Margery, pointing to the
top button.
</p>

<p>
There was only one way out of it.  I began to sing
a carol in a very shrill voice.
</p>

<p>
All the artist rose in Margery.
</p>

<p>
"Don't sing," she said hurriedly.  "Margie sing.
What will Margie sing, uncle?"
</p>

<p>
Before I could suggest anything, she was off.  It
was a scandalous song.  She began by announcing
that she wanted to be among the boys, and (guessing
that I should object) assured me that it was
no good kicking up a noise, because it was no fun
going out when there weren't any boys about, you
were so lonely-onely-onely ...
</p>

<p>
Here the tune became undecided; and, a chance
word recalling another context to her mind, she
drifted suddenly into a hymn, and sang it with the
same religious fervour as she had sung the other, her
fair head flung back and her hazel eyes gazing into
heaven ...
</p>

<p>
I listened carefully.  This was a bit I didn't
recognise....  The tune wavered for a moment ... and
out of it these words emerged triumphant,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Talk of me to the boys you meet,<br>
  Remember me kindly to Regent Street,<br>
  And give them my love in the&mdash;&mdash;"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What's 'at, uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"That," I said, stroking it, "is dear uncle's nose."
</p>

<p>
"What's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
By the way, would you like it all over again?
No?  Oh, very well.

<h3>
AFTERNOON SLEEP
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "In the afternoon they came unto a land<br>
  In which it seemed always afternoon."<br>
</p>

<p>
I am like Napoleon in that I can go to sleep at any
moment; I am unlike him (I believe) in that I am
always doing so.  One makes no apology for doing
so on Sunday afternoon&mdash;the apology, indeed, should
come from the others, the wakeful parties.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"Margery."
</p>

<p>
"Will you come and play wiv me?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm rather busy just now," I said, with closed
eyes.  "After tea."
</p>

<p>
"Why are you raver busy just now?  My baby's
only raver busy sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, you know what it's like; how
important it is that one shouldn't be disturbed."
</p>

<p>
"But you must be beturbed when I ask you to
come and play wiv me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well ... what shall we play at?"
</p>

<p>
"Trains," said Margery eagerly.
</p>

<p>
When we play trains I have to be a tunnel.  I
don't know if you have ever been a tunnel?  No;
well, it's an over-rated profession.
</p>

<p>
"We won't play trains," I announced firmly,
"because it's Sunday."
</p>

<p>
"Why not because it's Sunday?"
</p>

<p>
(Oh, you little pagan!)
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't mummy told you all about Sunday?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, Maud did tell me," said Margery
casually.  Then she gave an innocent little smile.
"Oh, I called mummy Maud," she said in pretended
surprise.  "I quite <i>fought</i> I was upstairs!"
</p>

<p>
I hope you follow.  The manners and customs of
good society must be observed on the ground floor
where visitors may happen; upstairs one relaxes a
little.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know," Margery went on with the air of
a discoverer, "you mustn't say 'prayers'
downstairs.  Or 'corsets.'"
</p>

<p>
"I never do," I affirmed.  "Well, anyhow I
never will again."
</p>

<p>
"Why mayn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," I said sleepily.
</p>

<p>
"Say prehaps."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;<i>prehaps</i> it's because your mother tells you
not to."
</p>

<p>
"Well, 'at's a <i>silly</i> fing to say," said Margery
scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"It is.  I'm thoroughly ashamed of it.  I apologise.
Good-night."  And I closed my eyes again.
</p>

<p>
"I fought you were going to play wiv me, Mr
Bingle," sighed Margery to herself.
</p>

<p>
"My name is <i>not</i> Bingle," I said, opening one eye.
</p>

<p>
"Why isn't it Bingle?"
</p>

<p>
"The story is a very long and sad one.  When I
wake up I will tell it to you.  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
"Tell it to me now."
</p>

<p>
There was no help for it.
</p>

<p>
"Once upon a time," I said rapidly, "there was
a man called Bingle, Oliver Bingle, and he married
a lady called Pringle.  And his brother married a
lady called Jingle.  And his other brother married a
Miss Wingle.  And his cousin remained single....
That is all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see," said Margery doubtfully.  "Now
will you play wiv me?"
</p>

<p>
How can one resist the pleading of a young cheild?
</p>

<p>
"All right," I said.  "We'll pretend I'm a little
girl, and you're my mummy, and you've just put me
to bed....  Good-night, mummy dear."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I must cover you up."  She fetched a
tablecloth, and a pram-cover, and <i>The Times</i>, and
a handkerchief, and the cat, and a doll's
what-I-mustn't-say-downstairs, and a cushion; and she
covered me up and tucked me in.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere, 'ere, now go to sleep, my darling," she said,
and kissed me lovingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Margie, you dear," I whispered.
</p>

<p>
"You called me 'Margie'!" she cried in horror.
</p>

<p>
"I meant 'Mummy.'  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
One, two, three seconds passed rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"It's morning," said a bright voice in my ear.
"Get up."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very ill," I pleaded; "I want to stay in bed
all day."
</p>

<p>
"But your dear uncle," said Margery, inventing
hastily, "came last night after you were in bed, and
stayed 'e night.  Do you see?  And he wants you
to sit on his chest in bed and talk to him."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?  Show me the bounder."
</p>

<p>
"'Ere he is," said Margery, pointing at me.
</p>

<p>
"But look here, I can't sit on my own chest and
talk to myself.  I'll take the two parts if you insist,
Sir Herbert, but I can't play them simultaneously.
Not even Irving&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why can't you play vem simrulaleously?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can't.  Margie, <i>will</i> you let me go to
sleep?"
</p>

<p>
"Nope," said Margery, shaking her head.
</p>

<p>
"You should say, 'No, thank you, revered and
highly respected uncle.'"
</p>

<p>
"No <i>hank</i> you, Mr Cann."
</p>

<p>
"I have already informed you that my name is not
Bingle; and I have now to add that neither is it
Cann."
</p>

<p>
"Why neiver is it Cann?"
</p>

<p>
"That isn't grammar.  You should say, 'Why
can it not either?'"
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Say prehaps."
</p>

<p>
"No, I can't even say prehaps."
</p>

<p>
"Well, say I shall understand when I'm a big girl."
</p>

<p>
"You'll understand when you're a big girl,
Margery," I said solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see."
</p>

<p>
"That's right.  Now then, what about going to
sleep?"
</p>

<p>
She was silent for a moment, and I thought I was
safe.  Then&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Uncle, just tell me&mdash;why was 'at little boy crying
vis morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Which little boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Ve one in 'e road."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that one.  Well, he was crying because his
uncle hadn't had any sleep all night, and when he
tried to go to sleep in the afternoon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Say prehaps again."
</p>

<p>
My first rejected contribution!  I sighed and had
another shot.  "Well, then," I said gallantly, "it
must have been because he hadn't got a sweet little
girl of three to play with him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Margery, nodding her head thoughtfully,
"'at was it."
</p>

A SCRATCH LOT

<p class="t3">
I. THE CHOOSING OF THE DAY
</p>

<p>
As soon as I had promised to take an eleven
down to Chartleigh I knew that I was in for
trouble; but I did not realise how great it would
be until I consulted Henry Barton.  Henry is a
first-class cricketer, and it was my idea that he should
do all the batting for us, and such of the bowling as
the laws allowed.  I had also another idea, and this
I explained to Henry.
</p>

<p>
"As you are aware," I said, "the ideal side
contains five good bats, four good bowlers, a
wicket-keeper, and Henry Barton."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," agreed Henry.
</p>

<p>
"That is the principle on which one selects an
eleven.  Now, I intend to strike out a line of my own.
My team shall consist of three authors or journalists,
two solicitors, four barristers, a couple from the
Stock Exchange, some civil servants and an artist or
two.  How many is that?"
</p>

<p>
"Nineteen."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's the idea, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"It's a rotten idea."
</p>

<p>
"No, it's a splendid idea.  I wonder nobody has
thought of it before.  I send a solicitor and a
journalist in first.  The journalist uses the long handle,
while the solicitor plays for keeps."
</p>

<p>
"And where does the artist come in?"
</p>

<p>
"The artist comes in last, and plays for a draw.
You are very slow to-day, Henry."
</p>

<p>
Henry, the man of leisure, thought a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's all very well for you working men," he
said at last, "but what do I go as?  Or am I one of
the barristers?"
</p>

<p>
"You go as 'with Barton.'  Yes.  If you're very
good you shall have an 'H' in brackets after you.
'With Barton (H)'"
</p>

<p>
The method of choosing my team being settled, the
next thing was the day.  "Any day in the first week
in July," the Chartleigh captain had said.  Now at
first sight there appear to be seven days in the week,
but it is not really so.  For instance, Saturday.
Now there's a good day!  What could one object to
in a Saturday?
</p>

<p>
But do you imagine Henry Barton would let it pass?
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you'll get eleven people for the
Saturday," he said.  "People are always playing
cricket on Saturday."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," I said.  "Healthy exercise for the
London toiler.  That's why I'm asking 'em."
</p>

<p>
"But I mean they'll have arranged to play already
with their own teams.  Or else they'll be going away
for week-ends."
</p>

<p>
"One can spend a very pretty week-end at Chartleigh."
</p>

<p>
"H'm, let me think.  Any day in the week, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Except, apparently, Saturday," I said huffily.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see now, what days are there?"
</p>

<p>
I mentioned two or three of the better-known ones.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Of course, some of those are impossible,
though.  We'd better go through the week and see
which is best."
</p>

<p>
I don't know who Barton is that he should take
it upon himself to make invidious distinctions
between the days of the week.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then," I said.  "Sunday."
</p>

<p>
"Ass."
</p>

<p>
That seemed to settle Sunday, so we passed on to
Monday.
</p>

<p>
"You won't get your stockbroker on Monday,"
said Henry.  "It's Contanger day or something
with them every Monday."
</p>

<p>
"Stocktaking, don't you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I dare say.  Anyhow, no one in the House can
get away on a Monday."
</p>

<p>
"I must have my stockbrokers.  Tuesday."
</p>

<p>
Tuesday, it seemed, was hopeless.  I was a fool to
have thought of Tuesday.  Why, everybody knew
that Tuesday was an impossible day for&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
I forget what spoilt Tuesday's chance.  I fancy
it was a busy day for Civil Servants.  No one in the
Home Civil can get away on a Tuesday.  I know that
sounds absurd, but Henry was being absurd just
then.  Or was it barristers?  Briefs get given out
on a Tuesday, I was made to understand.  That
brought us to Wednesday.  I hoped much from
Wednesday.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Henry.  "Wednesday might do.  Of
course most of the weeklies go to press on Wednesday.
Rather an awkward day for journalists.  What
about Thursday?"
</p>

<p>
I began to get annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"Thursday my flannel trousers go to the press,"
I said&mdash;"that is to say, they come back from the
wash then."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, why try to be funny?"
</p>

<p>
"Hang it, who started it?  Talking about
Contanger-days.  Contanger&mdash;it sounds like a new
kind of guano."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you don't believe me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Henry, I do.  Thursday be it, then."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose that's all right," said Henry
doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  Don't say it's sending-in day with
artists," I implored.  "Not <i>every</i> Thursday?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Only there's Friday, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Friday is <i>my</i> busy day," I pleaded&mdash;"my one
ewe lamb.  Do not rob me of it."
</p>

<p>
"It's a very good day, Friday.  I think you'd
find that most people could get off then."
</p>

<p>
"But why throw over Thursday like this?  A
good, honest day, Henry.  Many people get born on
a Thursday, Henry.  And it's a marrying day,
Henry.  A nice, clean, sober day, and you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The fact is," said Henry, "I've suddenly remembered
I'm engaged myself on Thursday."
</p>

<p>
This was too much.
</p>

<p>
"Henry," I said coldly, "you forget yourself&mdash;you
forget yourself strangely, my lad.  Just because
I was weak enough to promise you an 'H' after your
name.  You seem to have forgotten that the 'H'
was to be in brackets."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I'm afraid I really am engaged."
</p>

<p>
"Are you really?  Look here&mdash;I'll leave out the
'with' and you shall be one of us.  There!  Baby,
see the pretty gentlemen!"
</p>

<p>
Henry smiled and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," I said, "we must have you.  So if you
say Friday, Friday it is.  You're quite sure Friday
is all right for solicitors?  Very well, then."
</p>

<p>
So the day was settled for Friday.  It was rather
a pity, because, as I said, in the ordinary way Friday
is the day I put aside for work.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II. THE SELECTION COMMITTEE
</p>

<p>
The committee consisted of Henry and myself.
Originally it was myself alone, but as soon as
I had selected Henry I proceeded to co-opt him,
reserving to myself, however, the right of a casting
vote in case of any difference of opinion.  One
arose, almost immediately, over Higgins.  Henry
said:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
(<i>a</i>) That Higgins had once made ninety-seven.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
(<i>b</i>) That he had been asked to play for his
county.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
(<i>c</i>) That he was an artist, and we had arranged to
have an artist in the team.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
In reply I pointed out:
</p>

<p class="bullet">
(<i>a</i>) That ninety-seven was an extremely unlikely
number for anyone to have made.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
(<i>b</i>) That if he had been asked he evidently hadn't
accepted, which showed the sort of man he
was: besides which, what was his county?
</p>

<p class="bullet">
(<i>c</i>) That, assuming for the moment he had made
ninety-seven, was it likely he would consent
to go in last and play for a draw, which was
why we wanted the artist?  And that, anyhow,
he was a jolly bad artist.
</p>

<p class="bullet">
(d) That hadn't we better put it to the vote?
</p>

<p>
This was accordingly done, and an exciting division
ended in a tie.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Those in favour of Higgins &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
  Those against Higgins &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
</p>

<p>
The Speaker gave his casting vote against Higgins.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this, however, I had laid before the House
the letter of invitation.  It was as follows (and,
I flatter myself, combined tact with a certain
dignity):&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"DEAR&mdash;&mdash;, I am taking a team into the
country on Friday week to play against the village
eleven.  The ground and the lunch are good.  Do
you think you could manage to come down?  I
know you are very busy just now with
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contangers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clients,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Christmas Number,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varnishing Day,<br>
  (<i>Strike out all but one of these</i>)<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
but a day in the country would do you good.  I hear
from all sides that you are in great form this season.
I will give you all particulars about trains later on.
Good-bye.  Remember me to&mdash;&mdash;.  How is&mdash;&mdash;?
Ever yours.
</p>

<p>
"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Old Henry is playing for us.  He has
strained himself a little and probably won't bowl
much, so I expect we shall all have a turn with the
ball."
</p>

<p>
<i>Or</i>, "I don't think you have ever met Henry
Barton, the cricketer.  He is very keen on meeting
you.  Apparently he has seen you play somewhere.
He will be turning out for us on Friday.
</p>

<p>
"<i>P.P.S.</i>&mdash;We might manage to have some bridge
in the train."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"That," I said to Henry, "is what I call a clever
letter."
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think that?"
</p>

<p>
"It is all clever," I said modestly.  "But the
cleverest part is a sentence at the end.  'I will give
you all particulars about trains later on.'  You see
I have been looking them up, and we leave Victoria
at seven-thirty A.M. and get back to London Bridge
at eleven-forty-five P.M."
</p>

<p>
The answers began to come in the next day.  One
of the first was from Bolton, the solicitor, and it
upset us altogether.  For, after accepting the
invitation, he went on: "I am afraid I don't play bridge.
As you may remember, I used to play chess at
Cambridge, and I still keep it up."
</p>

<p>
"Chess," said Henry.  "That's where White
plays and mates in two moves.  And there's a Black
too.  He does something."
</p>

<p>
"We shall have to get a Black.  This is awful."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps Bolton would like to do problems by
himself all the time."
</p>

<p>
"That would be rather bad luck on him.  No,
look here.  Here's Carey.  Glad to come, but
doesn't bridge.  He's the man."
</p>

<p>
Accordingly we wired to Carey: "Do you play
chess?  Reply at once."  He answered, "No.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Carey will have to play that game with glass
balls.  Solitaire.  Yes.  We must remember to
bring a board with us."
</p>

<p>
"But what about the chess gentleman?" asked Henry.
</p>

<p>
"I must go and find one.  We've had one refusal."
</p>

<p>
There is an editor I know slightly, so I called upon
him at his office.  I found him writing verses.
</p>

<p>
"Be brief," he said, "I'm frightfully busy."
</p>

<p>
"I have just three questions to ask you," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"What rhymes with 'yorker'?"
</p>

<p>
"That wasn't one of them."
</p>

<p>
"Yorker&mdash;corker&mdash;por&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Better make it a full pitch," I suggested.  "Step
out and make it a full pitch.  Then there are such
lots of rhymes."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, I will.  Well?"
</p>

<p>
"One.  Do you play bridge?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Two.  Do you play chess?"
</p>

<p>
"I can."
</p>

<p>
"Three.  Do you play cricket?  Not that it matters."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do sometimes.  Good-bye.  Send me a
proof, will you?  By the way, what paper is this
for?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>The Sportsman</i>, if you'll play.  On Friday week.  Do."
</p>

<p>
"Anything, if you'll go."
</p>

<p>
"May I have that in writing?"
</p>

<p>
He handed me a rejection form.
</p>

<p>
"There you are.  And I'll do anything you like
on Friday."
</p>

<p>
I went back to Henry and told him the good news.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if he'll mind being black," said Henry.
"That's the chap that always gets mated so quickly."
</p>

<p>
"I expect they'll arrange it among themselves.
Anyhow, we've done our best for them."
</p>

<p>
"It's an awful business, getting up a team," said
Henry thoughtfully.  "Well, we shall have two
decent sets of bridge, anyway.  But you ought to
have arranged for twelve aside, and then we could
have left out the chess professors and had three sets."
</p>

<p>
"It's all the fault of the rules.  Some day somebody
will realise that four doesn't go into eleven, and
then we shall have a new rule."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think so," said Henry.  "I don't
fancy 'Wanderer' would allow it."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
III. IN THE TRAIN
</p>

<p>
If there is one thing I cannot stand, it is ingratitude.
Take the case of Carey.  Carey, you may remember,
professed himself unable to play either bridge or
chess; and as we had a three-hour journey before us
it did not look as though he were going to have much
of a time.  However, Henry and I, thinking entirely
of Carey's personal comfort, went to the trouble of
buying him a solitaire board, with glass balls
complete.  The balls were all in different colours.
</p>

<p>
I laid this before Carey as soon as we settled in the
train.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever's that?"
</p>

<p>
"The new game," I said.  "It's all the rage now,
the man tells me.  The Smart Set play it every
Sunday.  Young girls are inveigled into lonely
country houses and robbed of incredible sums."
</p>

<p>
Carey laughed scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"So it is alleged," I added.  "The inventor
claims for it that in some respects it has advantages
which even cricket cannot claim.  As, for instance,
it can be played in any weather: nay, even upon the
sick bed."
</p>

<p>
"And how exactly is it played?"
</p>

<p>
"Thus.  You take one away and all the rest jump
over each other.  At each jump you remove the
jumpee, and the object is to clear the board.  Hence
the name&mdash;solitaire."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  It seems a pretty rotten game."
</p>

<p>
That made me angry.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Then don't play.  Have a game of
marbles on the rack instead."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Henry was introducing Bolton and the
editor to each other.
</p>

<p>
"Two such famous people," he began.
</p>

<p>
"Everyone," said Bolton, with a bow, "knows the
editor of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, there's that.  But I meant two such
famous chess players.  Bolton," he explained to the
editor, "was twelfth man against Oxford some years
ago.  Something went wrong with his heart, or he'd
have got in.  On his day, and if the board was at all
sticky, he used to turn a good deal from QB4."
</p>

<p>
"Do you really play?" asked Bolton eagerly.
"I have a board here."
</p>

<p>
"Does he play!  Do you mean to say you have
never heard of the Trocadero Defence?"
</p>

<p>
"The Sicilian Defence&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The Trocadero Defence.  It's where you palm
the other man's queen when he's not looking.  Most
effective opening."
</p>

<p>
They both seemed keen on beginning, so Henry
got out the cards for the rest of us.
</p>

<p>
I drew the younger journalist, against Henry and
the senior stockbroker.  Out of compliment to the
journalist we arranged to play half-a-crown a
hundred, that being about the price they pay him.  I
dealt, and a problem arose immediately.  Here it is.
</p>

<p>
"A deals and leaves it to his partner B, who
goes No Trumps.  Y leads a small heart.  B's
hand consists of king and three small diamonds,
king and one other heart, king and three small
clubs, and three small spades.  A plays the king
from Dummy, and Z puts on the ace.  What should
A do?"
</p>

<p>
Answer.  Ring communication-cord and ask
guard to remove B.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," I said to Dummy.  "One thing's
pretty clear.  You don't bowl to-day.  Long-leg
both ends is about your mark.  Somewhere where
there's plenty of throwing to do."
</p>

<p>
Later on, when I was Dummy, I strolled over to
the chess players.
</p>

<p>
"What's the ground like?" said the editor, as he
finessed a knight.
</p>

<p>
"Sporting.  Distinctly sporting."
</p>

<p>
"Long grass all round, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, lord, no.  The cows eat up all that."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say the cows are allowed on the
pitch?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, they don't put it that way, quite.  The
pitch is allowed on the cows' pasture land."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose if we make a hundred we shall do
well?" asked somebody.
</p>

<p>
"If we make fifty we shall declare," I said.  "By
Jove, Bolton, that's a pretty smart move."
</p>

<p>
I may not know all the technical terms, but I do
understand the idea of chess.  The editor was a pawn
up and three to play, and had just advanced his queen
against Bolton's king, putting on a lot of check side
as it seemed to me.  Of course, I expected Bolton
would have to retire his king; but not he!  He laid
a stymie with his bishop, and it was the editor's
queen that had to withdraw.  Yet Bolton was only
spare man at Cambridge!
</p>

<p>
"I am not at all sure," I said, "that chess is not a
finer game even than solitaire."
</p>

<p>
"It's a finer game than cricket," said Bolton,
putting his bishop back in the slips again.
</p>

<p>
"No," said the editor.  "Cricket is the finest
game in the world.  For why?  I will tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks to the glorious uncertainty of our national
pastime," began the journalist, from his next
Monday's article.
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks to the fact that it is a game in which
one can produce the maximum of effect with the
minimum of skill.  Take my own case.  I am not a
batsman, I shall never make ten runs in an innings,
yet how few people realise that!  I go in first wicket
down, wearing my M.C.C. cap.  Having taken guard
with the help of a bail, I adopt Palairet's stance at the
wicket.  Then the bowler delivers: either to the off,
to leg, or straight.  If it is to the off, I shoulder my
bat and sneer at it.  If it is to leg, I swing at it.
I have a beautiful swing, which is alone worth the
money.  Probably I miss, but the bowler fully understands
that it is because I have not yet got the pace
of the wicket.  Sooner or later he sends down a
straight one, whereupon I proceed to glide it to leg.
You will see the stroke in Beldam's book.  Of course,
I miss the ball, and am given out l.b.w.  Then the
look of astonishment that passes over my face, the
bewildered inquiry of the wicket-keeper, and finally
the shrug of good-humoured resignation as I walk from
the crease!  Nine times out of ten square-leg asks
the umpire what county I play for.  That is cricket."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," I said, when he had finished.
"There's only one flaw in it.  That is that quite
possibly you may have to go in last to-day.  You'll
have to think of some other plan.  Also on this wicket
the ball always goes well over your head.  You
couldn't be l.b.w. if you tried."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but I do try."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Well, you'll find it difficult."
</p>

<p>
The editor sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall have to retire hurt," he said.
</p>

<p>
Bolton chuckled to himself.
</p>

<p>
"One never retires hurt at chess," he said, as he
huffed the editor's king.  "Though once," he added
proudly, "I sprained my hand, and had to make all
my moves with the left one.  Check."
</p>

<p>
The editor yawned, and looked out of the window.
</p>

<p>
"Are we nearly there?" he asked.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
IV. IN THE FIELD
</p>

<p>
It is, I consider, the duty of a captain to consult the
wishes of his team now and then, particularly when
he is in command of such a heterogeneous collection
of the professions as I was.  I was watching a match
at the Oval once, and at the end of an over Lees went
up to Dalmeny, and had a few words with him.
Probably, I thought, he is telling him a good story
that he heard at lunch; or, maybe, he is asking
for the latest gossip from the Lobby.  My neighbour,
however, held other views.
</p>

<p>
"There," he said, "there's ole Walter Lees asking
to be took off."
</p>

<p>
"Surely not," I answered.  "Dalmeny had a
telegram just now, and Lees is asking if it's the
three-thirty winner."
</p>

<p>
Lees then began to bowl again.
</p>

<p>
"There you are," I said triumphantly, but my
neighbour wouldn't hear of it.
</p>

<p>
"Ole Lees asked to be took off, and ole Dalmeny"
(I forget how he pronounced it, but I know it was one
of the wrong ways)&mdash;"ole Dalmeny told him he'd
have to stick on a bit."
</p>

<p>
Now that made a great impression on me, and I
agreed with my friend that Dalmeny was in the
wrong.
</p>

<p>
"When I am captaining a team," I said, "and one
of the bowlers wants to come off, I am always ready
to meet him half-way, more than half-way.  Better
than that, if I have resolved upon any course of
action, I always let my team know beforehand; and
I listen to their objections in a fair-minded spirit."
</p>

<p>
It was in accordance with this rule of mine that I
said casually, as we were changing, "If we win the
toss I shall put them in."
</p>

<p>
There was a chorus of protest.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, go it," I said.  "Henry objects
because, as a first-class cricketer, he is afraid of what
<i>The Sportsman</i> will say if we lose.  The editor
naturally objects&mdash;it ruins his chance of being
mistaken for a county player if he has to field first.
Bolton objects because heavy exercise on a hot day
spoils his lunch.  Thompson objects because that's
the way he earns his living at the Bar.  His objection
is merely technical, and is reserved as a point
of law for the Court of Crown Cases Reserved.
Markham is a socialist and objects to authority.
Also he knows he's got to field long-leg both ends.
Gerald&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But why?" said Henry.
</p>

<p>
"Because I want you all to see the wicket first.
Then you can't say you weren't warned."  Whereupon
I went out and lost the toss.
</p>

<p>
As we walked into the field the editor told me a
very funny story.  I cannot repeat it here for various
reasons.  First, it has nothing to do with cricket;
and, secondly, it is, I understand, coming out in his
next number, and I should probably get into trouble.
Also it is highly technical, and depends largely for its
success upon adequate facial expression.  But it
amused me a good deal.  Just as he got to the
exciting part, Thompson came up.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind if I go cover?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Do," I said abstractedly.  "And what did the
vicar say?"
</p>

<p>
The editor chuckled.  "Well, you see, the vicar,
knowing, of course, that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Cover, I suppose," said Gerald, as he caught us up.
</p>

<p>
"What?  Oh yes, please.  The vicar did know, did he?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the vicar <i>knew</i>.  That's really the whole point."
</p>

<p>
I shouted with laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Good, isn't it?" said the editor.  "Well,
then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Have you got a cover?" came Markham's voice
from behind us.
</p>

<p>
I turned round.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Markham," I said, "I shall want you
cover, if you don't mind.  Sorry&mdash;I must tell these
men where to go&mdash;well, then, you were saying&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The editor continued the story.  We were interrupted
once or twice, but he finished it just as their
first two men came out.  I particularly liked that bit
about the&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Jove," I said suddenly, "we haven't got a
wicket-keeper.  That's always the way.  Can you keep?"
I asked the editor.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't there anyone else?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid they're all fielding cover," I said,
remembering suddenly.  "But, look here, it's the
chance of a lifetime for you.  You can tell 'em all
that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But he was trotting off to the pavilion.
</p>

<p>
"Can anybody lend me some gloves?" he asked.
"They want me to keep wicket.  Thing I've never
done in my life.  Of course I always field cover in the
ordinary way.  Thanks awfully.  Sure you don't
mind?  Don't suppose I shall stop a ball though."
</p>

<p>
"Henry," I called, "you're starting that end.
Arrange the field, will you?  I'll go cover.  You're
sure to want one."
</p>

<p>
Their first batsman was an old weather-beaten
villager called George.  We knew his name was
George because the second ball struck him in the
stomach and his partner said, "Stay there, George,"
which seemed to be George's idea too.  We learnt at
lunch that once, in the eighties or so, he had gone in
first with Lord Hawke (which put him on a level with
that player), and that he had taken first ball (which
put him just above the Yorkshireman).
</p>

<p>
There the story ended, so far as George was
concerned; and indeed it was enough.  Why seek to
inquire if George took any other balls besides the
first?
</p>

<p>
In our match, however, he took the second in the
place that I mentioned, the third on the back of the
neck, the fourth on the elbow, and the fifth in the
original place; while the sixth, being off the wicket,
was left there.  Nearly every batsman had some pet
stroke, and we soon saw that George's stroke was the
leg-bye.  His bat was the second line of defence, and
was kept well in the block.  If the ball escaped the
earthwork in front, there was always a chance that
it would be brought up by the bat.  Once, indeed, a
splendid ball of Henry's which came with his arm and
missed George's legs, snicked the bat, and went
straight into the wicket-keeper's hands.  The editor,
however, presented his compliments, and regretted
that he was unable to accept the enclosed, which he
accordingly returned with many thanks.
</p>

<p>
There was an unwritten law that George could not
be l.b.w.  I cannot say how it arose&mdash;possibly from
a natural coyness on George's part about the exact
significance of the "l."  Henry, after appealing for
the best part of three overs, gave it up, and bowled
what he called "googlies" at him.  This looked more
hopeful, because a googly seems in no way to be
restricted as to the number of its bounces, and at each
bounce it had a chance of doing something.
Unfortunately it never did George.  Lunch came and
the score was thirty-seven&mdash;George having compiled
in two hours a masterly nineteen; eighteen off the
person, but none the less directly due to him.
</p>

<p>
"We must think of a plan of campaign at lunch,"
said Henry.  "It's hopeless to go on like this."
</p>

<p>
"Does George drink?" I asked anxiously.  It
seemed the only chance.
</p>

<p>
But George didn't.  And the score was thirty seven
for five, which is a good score for the wicket.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
V. AT THE WICKETS
</p>

<p>
At lunch I said: "I have just had a wire from the
Surrey committee to say that I may put myself on
to bowl."
</p>

<p>
"That is good hearing," said Henry.
</p>

<p>
"Did they hear?" asked Gerald anxiously, looking
over at the Chartleigh team.
</p>

<p>
"You may think you're very funny, but I'll bet
you a&mdash;a&mdash;anything you like that I get George out."
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Gerald.  "I'll play you for
second wicket down, the loser to go in last."
</p>

<p>
"Done," I said, "and what about passing the
salad now?"
</p>

<p>
After lunch the editor took me on one side and
said: "I don't like it.  I don't like it at all."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you have so much?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I mean the wicket.  It's dangerous.  I am not
thinking of myself so much as of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As of the reading public?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite so."
</p>

<p>
"You think you&mdash;you would be missed in Fleet
Street&mdash;just at first?"
</p>

<p>
"You are not putting the facts too strongly.  I
was about to suggest that I should be a 'did not
bat.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I see.  Perhaps I ought to tell you that I
was talking just now to the sister of their captain."
</p>

<p>
The editor looked interested.
</p>

<p>
"About the pad of the gardener?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"About you.  She said&mdash;I give you her own
words&mdash;'Who is the tall, handsome man keeping
wicket in a M.C.C. cap?'  So I said you were a
well-known county player, as she would see when you
went in to bat."
</p>

<p>
The editor shook my hand impressively.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much," he said.  "I shall not
fail her.  What county did you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Part of Flint.  You know the little bit that's
got into the wrong county by mistake?  That part.
She had never heard of it; but I assured her it had
a little bit of yellow all to itself on the map.  Have
you a pretty good eleven?"
</p>

<p>
The editor swore twice&mdash;once for me and once for
Flint.  Then we went out into the field.
</p>

<p>
My first ball did for George.  I followed the tactics
of William the First at the Battle of Hastings, 1066.
You remember how he ordered his archers to shoot
into the air, and how one arrow fell and pierced the
eye of Harold, whereupon confusion and disaster
arose.  So with George.  I hurled one perpendicularly
into the sky, and it dropped (after a long time)
straight upon the batsman.  George followed it with
a slightly contemptuous eye... all the way....
</p>

<p>
All the way.  Of course, I was sorry.  We were
all much distressed.  They told us afterwards he
had never been hit in the eye before....  One gets
new experiences.
</p>

<p>
George retired hurt.  Not so much hurt as piqued,
I fancy.  He told the umpire it wasn't bowling.
Possibly.  Neither was it batting.  It was just
superior tactics.
</p>

<p>
The innings soon closed, and we had sixty-one to
win, and, what seemed more likely, fifty-nine and
various other numbers to lose.  Sixty-one is a very
unlucky number with me&mdash;oddly enough I have never
yet made sixty-one; like W.G. Grace, who had never
made ninety-three.  My average this season is five,
which is a respectable number.  As Bolton pointed
out&mdash;if we each got five to-day, and there were six
extras, we should win.  I suppose if one plays chess
a good deal one thinks of these things.
</p>

<p>
Harold, I mean George, refused to field, so I nobly
put myself in last and substituted for him.  This was
owing to an argument as to the exact wording of my
bet with Gerald.
</p>

<p>
"You said you'd get him out," said Gerald.
</p>

<p>
"I mean 'out of the way,' 'out of the field,'
'out of&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"I meant 'out' according to the laws of cricket.
There are nine ways.  Which was yours, I should
like to know?"
</p>

<p>
"Obstructing the ball."
</p>

<p>
"There you are."
</p>

<p>
I shifted my ground.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't say I'd get him out," I explained.  "I
said I'd get him.  Those were my very words.
'I will get George.'  Can you deny that I got him?"
</p>

<p>
"Even if you said that, which you didn't, the
common construction that one puts upon the phrase
is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you are going to use long words like that," I
said, "I must refer you to my solicitor Bolton."
</p>

<p>
Whereupon Bolton took counsel's opinion, and
reported that he could not advise me to proceed in
the matter.  So Gerald took second wicket, and I
fielded.
</p>

<p>
However, one advantage of fielding was that I saw
the editor's innings from start to finish at the closest
quarters.  He came in at the end of the first over,
and took guard for "left hand round the wicket."
</p>

<p>
"Would you give it me?" he said to Bolton.
"These country umpires....  Thanks.  And what's
that over the wicket?  Thanks."
</p>

<p>
He marked two places with the bail.
</p>

<p>
"How about having it from here?" I suggested
at mid-on.  "It's quite a good place and we're in a
straight line with the church."
</p>

<p>
The editor returned the bail, and held up his bat
again.
</p>

<p>
"That 'one-leg' all right?  Thanks."
</p>

<p>
He was proceeding to look round the field when a
gentle voice from behind him said: "If you wouldn't
mind moving a bit, sir, I could bowl."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is it over?" said the editor airily, trying to
hide his confusion.  "I beg your pardon, I beg your
pardon."
</p>

<p>
Still he had certainly impressed the sister of their
captain, and it was dreadful to think of the
disillusionment that might follow at any moment.
However, as it happened, he had yet another trick
up his sleeve.  Bolton hit a ball to cover, and the
editor, in the words of the local paper, "most
sportingly sacrificed his wicket when he saw that his
partner had not time to get back.  It was a question,
however, whether there was ever a run possible."
</p>

<p>
Which shows that the reporter did not know of the
existence of their captain's sister.
</p>

<p>
When I came in, the score was fifty-one for nine,
and Henry was still in.  I had only one ball to play, so
I feel that I should describe it in full.  I have four good
scoring strokes&mdash;the cut, the drive, the hook and the
glance.  As the bowler ran up to the crease I decided
to cut the ball to the ropes.  Directly, however, it
left his hand, I saw that it was a ball to hook, and
accordingly I changed my attitude to the one usually
adopted for that stroke.  But the ball came up
farther than I expected, so at the last moment I
drove it hard past the bowler.  That at least was the
idea.  Actually, it turned out to be a beautiful glance
shot to the leg boundary.  Seldom, if ever, has
Beldam had such an opportunity for four action
photographs on one plate.
</p>

<p>
Henry took a sixer next ball, and so we won.  And
the rest of the story of my team, is it not written in
the journals of <i>The Sportsman</i> and <i>The Chartleigh
Watchman</i>, and in the hearts of all who were
privileged to compose it?  But how the editor took
two jokes I told him in the train, and put them in his
paper (as his own), and how Carey challenged the
engine-driver to an eighteen-hole solitaire match, and
how ... these things indeed shall never be divulged.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0403"></a></p>

<h3>
EX NIHILO FIT MULTUM
</h3>

<p>
I should like to explain just what happened to
the ball.  In the first place it was of an
irreproachable length, and broke very sharply and
cleverly from the leg.  (The bowler, I am sure, will
bear me out in this.)  Also it rose with great
suddenness ... and, before I had time to perfect any
adequate system of defence, took me on the knee, and
from there rolled on to the off-stump.  There was a
considerable amount of applause on the part of the
field, due, no doubt, to the feeling that a dangerous
batsman had been dismissed without scoring.  I need
hardly add that I did not resent this appreciation.
</p>

<p>
What I really wished to say to the wicket-keeper
was (1) that it was the first fast wicket I had played
on this summer; (2) that it was my first nought this
season, and, hang it, even Fry made noughts
sometimes; and (3) that personally I always felt that
it didn't matter what one made oneself so long
as one's side was victorious.  What I actually said
was shorter; but I expect the wicket-keeper
understood just as well.  He seemed an intelligent
fellow.
</p>

<p>
After that, I walked nine miles back to the pavilion.
</p>

<p>
The next man was brushing his hair in the dressing-room.
</p>

<p>
"What's happened?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," I said truthfully.
</p>

<p>
"But you're out, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that nothing has eventuated&mdash;accrued,
as it were."
</p>

<p>
"Blob?  Bad luck.  Is my parting straight?"
</p>

<p>
"It curls a bit from leg up at the top, but it will
do.  Mind you make some.  I always feel that so
long as one's side is victorious&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But he was gone.  I brushed my own hair very
carefully, lit a cigarette, and went outside to the
others.  I always think that a nought itself is
nothing&mdash;the way one carries it off is everything.  A
disaster, not only to himself but also to his side,
should not make a man indifferent to his personal
appearance.
</p>

<p>
"Bad luck," said somebody.  "Did it come back?"
</p>

<p>
"Very quickly.  We both did."
</p>

<p>
"He wasn't breaking much when I was in," said
some tactless idiot.
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you get out?" I retorted.
</p>

<p>
"L.b.w."
</p>

<p>
I moved quickly away from him, and sat next to
a man who had yet to go in.
</p>

<p>
"Bad luck," he said.  "Second ball, wasn't it?
I expect I shall do the same."
</p>

<p>
I thought for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think you will have a second?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
"To judge from the easy way in which those two
are knocking the bowling about, I sha'n't even have a
first," he smiled.
</p>

<p>
I moved on again.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo," said a voice.  "I saw you get out.  How
many did you make?"
</p>

<p>
"None," I said wearily.
</p>

<p>
"How many?"
</p>

<p>
I went and sat down next to him.
</p>

<p>
"Guess," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't."
</p>

<p>
"Well, think of a number."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Double it.  Divide by two.  Take away the number
you first thought of.  What does that make?"
</p>

<p>
"A hundred."
</p>

<p>
"You must have done it wrong," I said suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"No, I am sure I didn't....  No, it still comes
to a hundred."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I must have made a hundred," I said
excitedly.  "Are you <i>sure</i> you haven't made a
mistake?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'd better go and tell the scorer.  He put
me down a blob&mdash;silly ass."
</p>

<p>
"He's a bad scorer, I know."
</p>

<p>
"By the way," I said, as I got up, "what
number did you think of?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's like this.  When you asked me to guess
what you had made I instinctively thought of blob,
only I didn't like to say so.  Then when you began
that number game I started with a hundred&mdash;it's such
an easy number.  Double&mdash;two hundred.  Divided by
two&mdash;one hundred.  Take away the number you
first thought of&mdash;that's blob, and you have a hundred
left.  Wasn't that right?"
</p>

<p>
"You idiot," I said angrily.  "Of course it wasn't."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't get sick about it.  We all make
mistakes."
</p>

<p>
"Sick, I'm not sick.  Only just for the moment....
I really thought....  Well, I shall never be so near
a century again."
</p>

<p>
At lunch I sat next to one of their side.
</p>

<p>
"How many did you make?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not very many," I said.
</p>

<p>
"How many?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hardly any.  None at all, practically."
</p>

<p>
"How many actually?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>And</i> actually," I said.  ("Fool.")
</p>

<p>
After lunch a strange man happened to be talking
to me.
</p>

<p>
"And why did <i>you</i> get out?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
It was a silly question and deserved a silly answer.
Besides, I was sick of it all by this time.
</p>

<p>
"Point's moustache put me off," I said.
</p>

<p>
"What was wrong with Point's moustache?"
</p>

<p>
"It swerved the wrong way."
</p>

<p>
"I was fielding point," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry.  But if you had recognised me,
you wouldn't have asked why I got out, and if I had
recognised you I shouldn't have told you.  So let's
forgive and forget."
</p>

<p>
I hoped that the subject was really closed this
time.  Of course, I knew that kind friends and
relations would ask me on the morrow how many I had
made, but for that day I wanted no more of it.  Yet,
as it happened, I reopened the subject myself.
</p>

<p>
For with five minutes to play their ninth wicket
fell.  Mid-off sauntered over towards me.
</p>

<p>
"Just as well we didn't stay in any longer."
</p>

<p>
"That's <i>just</i> what I thought," I said triumphantly,
"all along."
</p>

<h3>
  AN AVERAGE MAN
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Of Tomkins as a natural cricketer<br>
  It frequently has been remarked&mdash;that IF<br>
  He'd had more opportunities of bowling,<br>
  And rather more encouragement in batting,<br>
  And IF his averages, so disclosed,<br>
  Batting and bowling, had been interchanged;<br>
  And IF the field as usually set<br>
  Contained some post (at the pavilion end)<br>
  Whose presence rather than a pair of hands<br>
  Was called for; then, before the season finished,<br>
  Tomkins would certainly have played for Kent.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All this, however, is beside the mark.<br>
  Just now I wish to hymn the glorious day<br>
  (Ignored by those who write the almanacs,<br>
  Unnoticed by the calendar compilers),<br>
  That Wednesday afternoon, twelve months ago<br>
  When Tomkins raised his average to two.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thanks to an interval of accidents<br>
  (As "Tomkins did not bat"&mdash;and "not out 0,"<br>
  But this more rarely) Tomkins' average<br>
  Had long remained at 1.3.<br>
  (Though Tomkins, sacrificing truth to pride,<br>
  Or both to euphony, left out the dot&mdash;<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Left out the little dot upon the three,<br>
  Only employing it to justify<br>
  A second three to follow on the first.<br>
  Thus, if a stranger asked his average<br>
  Tomkins would answer "One point thirty-three"&mdash;<br>
  Nor lay the stress unduly on the "one" ...).<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A curious thing is custom!  There are men&mdash;<br>
  Plum Warner is, of course, a case in point&mdash;<br>
  Who cannot bat unless they go in first.<br>
  Others, as Hayes and Denton, have their place<br>
  First wicket down; while Number Six or so<br>
  Is suited best to Jessop.  As for Tomkins<br>
  His place was always one above the Byes,<br>
  And three above the Wides.  So Custom willed.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Upon this famous Wednesday afternoon<br>
  Wickets had fallen fast before the onslaught<br>
  Of one who had, as Euclid might have put it,<br>
  No length, or break, but only pace; and pace<br>
  Had been too much for nine of them already.<br>
  Then entered Tomkins the invincible.<br>
  Took guard as usual, "just outside the leg,"<br>
  Looked round the field, and mentally decided<br>
  To die&mdash;or raise his average to two.<br>
  Whereon&mdash;for now the bowler was approaching,<br>
  He struck a scientific attitude,<br>
  Advanced the left leg firmly down the pitch,<br>
  And swung his bat along the line AB<br>
  (See Ranjitsinhji's famous book of cricket).<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And when the bat and leg were both at B<br>
  (Having arrived there more or less together),<br>
  Then Tomkins, with his usual self-effacement,<br>
  Modestly closed his eyes, and left the rest<br>
  To Providence and Ranjy and the bowler<br>
  (Forming a quorum); two at least of whom<br>
  Resolved that he should neatly glide the ball<br>
  Somewhere between the first and second slips.<br>
  So Tomkins did compile a chanceless two.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Once more the bowler rushed upon the crease,<br>
  While Tomkins made a hasty calculation<br>
  (Necessitating use of decimals)<br>
  And found his average was 1.5.<br>
  So lustily he smote and drove the ball<br>
  Loftily over long stop's head for one;<br>
  Which brought the decimal to seventy-five,<br>
  And Tomkins, puffing, to the other end.<br>
  Then, feeling that the time for risks was come,<br>
  He rolled his sleeves up, blew upon his hands,<br>
  And played back to a yorker, and was bowled.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Every position has its special charm.<br>
  You go in first and find as a reward<br>
  The wicket at its best; you go in later<br>
  And find the fielders slack, the bowling loose.<br>
  Tomkins, who went in just above the Byes,<br>

SMALL GAMES

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
PHYSICAL CULTURE
</h3>

<p>
"Why don't you sit up?" said Adela at
dinner, suddenly prodding me in the back.
Adela is old enough to take a motherly interest in my
figure, and young enough to look extremely pretty
while doing so.
</p>

<p>
"I always stoop at meals," I explained; "it helps
the circulation.  My own idea."
</p>

<p>
"But it looks so bad.  You ought&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't improve me," I begged,
</p>

<p>
"No wonder you have&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  I haven't.  I got a bullet on the liver in
the campaign of '03, due to over-smoking, and sometimes
it hurts me a little in the cold weather.  That's
all."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you try the Hyperion?"
</p>

<p>
"I will.  Where is it?"
</p>

<p>
"It isn't anywhere; you buy it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I thought you dined at it.  What do you buy
it for?"
</p>

<p>
"It's one of those developers with elastics and
pulleys and so on.  Every morning early, for
half-an-hour before breakfast&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You <i>are</i> trying to improve me," I said
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"But they are such good things," went on Adela
earnestly.  "They really do help to make you
beautiful&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I <i>am</i> beautiful."
</p>

<p>
"Well, much more beautiful.  And strong&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Are you being simply as tactful as you can be?"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;and graceful."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't as though you were actually a relation," I
protested.
</p>

<p>
Adela continued, full of her ideas:
</p>

<p>
"It would do you so much good, you know.
Would you promise me to use it every day if I sent
you mine?"
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you want yours any more now?
Are you perfect now?"
</p>

<p>
"You can easily hook it to the wall&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," I reflected, "there is a limit of
beauty beyond which it is dangerous to go.  After that,
either the thing would come off the hook, or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Adela suddenly, "aren't I looking well?"
</p>

<p>
"You're looking radiant," I said appreciatively;
"but it may only be because you're going to marry
Billy next month."
</p>

<p>
She smiled and blushed.  "Well, I'll send it to
you," she said.  "And you try it for a week, and then
tell me if you don't feel better.  Oh, and don't do all
the exercises to begin with; start with three or four
of the easy ones."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I said.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
I undid the wrappings eagerly, took off the lid of
the box, and was confronted with (apparently) six
pairs of braces.  I shook them out of the box and
saw I had made a mistake.  It was one pair of braces
for Magog.  I picked it up, and I knew that I was
in the presence of the Hyperion.  In five minutes I
had screwed a hook into the bedroom wall and
attached the beautifier.  Then I sat on the edge of
the bed and looked at it.
</p>

<p>
There was a tin plate, fastened to the top, with the
word "LADIES" on it.  I got up, removed it with
a knife, and sat down again.  Everything was very
dusty, and I wondered when Adela had last developed
herself.
</p>

<p>
By-and-by I went into the other room to see if I
had overlooked anything.  I found on the floor a
chart of exercises, and returned triumphantly with it.
</p>

<p>
There were thirty exercises altogether, and the
chart gave
</p>

<p>
(1) A detailed explanation of how to do each
particular exercise;
</p>

<p>
(2) A photograph of a lady doing it.
</p>

<p>
"After all," I reassured myself, after the first
bashful glance, "it is Adela who has thrust this upon
me; and she must have known."  So I studied it.
</p>

<p>
Nos. 10, 15 and 28 seemed the easiest; I decided
to confine myself to them.  For the first of these you
strap yourself in at the waist, grasp the handles, and
fall slowly backwards until your head touches the
floor&mdash;all the elastic cords being then at full stretch.
When I had got very slowly halfway down, an extra
piece of elastic which had got hitched somewhere
came suddenly into play, and I did the rest of the
journey without a stop, finishing up sharply against
the towel horse.  The chart had said, "Inhale going
down," and I was inhaling hard at the moment that
the towel horse and two damp towels spread
themselves over my face.
</p>

<p>
"So much for Exercise 10," I thought, as I got
up.  "I'll just get the idea to-night, and then start
properly to-morrow.  Now for No. 15."
</p>

<p>
Somehow I felt instinctively that No. 15 would
cause trouble.  For No. 15 you stand on the right
foot, fasten the left foot to one of the cords, and
stretch it out as far as you can....
</p>

<p>
What&mdash;officially&mdash;you do then, I cannot say....
</p>

<p>
Some people can stand easily upon the right foot,
when the left is fastened to the wall ... others
cannot ... it is a gift....
</p>

<p>
Having recovered from my spontaneous rendering
of No. 15 I turned to No. 28.  This one, I realised,
was extremely important; I would do it twelve
times.
</p>

<p>
You begin by lying flat on the floor, roped in at the
waist, and with your hands (grasping the elastic
cords) held straight up in the air.  The tension on
your waist is then extreme, but on your hands only
moderate.  Then, taking a deep breath, you pull
your arms slowly out until they lie along the floor.
The tension becomes terrific, the strain on every
part of you is immense.  While I lay there, taking a
deep breath before relaxing, I said to myself, "The
strain will be too much for me."
</p>

<p>
I was wrong.  It was too much for the hook.
The hook whizzed out, everything flew at me at
once, and I remembered no more....
</p>

<p>
As I limped into bed, I trod heavily upon something
sharp.  I shrieked and bent down to see what
had bitten me.  It was a tin plate bearing the words
"LADIES."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Adela, a week later.
</p>

<p>
I looked at her for a long time.
</p>

<p>
"When did you last use the Hyperion?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"About a year ago."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! ... You don't remember the chart that went
with it?"
</p>

<p>
"Not well.  Except, of course, that each exercise
was arranged for a particular object according to
what you wanted."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  So I discovered yesterday.  It was
in very small type, and I missed it at first."
</p>

<p>
"Well, how many did you do?"
</p>

<p>
"I limited myself to Exercises 10, 15, and 28.  Do
you happen to remember what those were for?"
</p>

<p>
"Not particularly."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Well, I started with No. 10.  No. 10, you
may recall, is one of the most perilous.  I nearly died
over No. 10.  And when I had been doing it for a
week, I discovered what its particular object was."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"'<i>To round the forearm!</i>'  Yes, madam," I said
bitterly, "I have spent a week of agony ... and I
have rounded one forearm."
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you try another?"
</p>

<p>
"I did.  I tried No. 15.  Six times in the pursuit
of No. 15 have I been shot up to the ceiling by the
left foot ... and what for, Adela?  '<i>To arch the
instep!</i>'  Look at my instep!  Why should I want
to arch it?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could remember which chart I sent you,"
said Adela, wrinkling her brow.
</p>

<p>
"It was the wrong one," I said....
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Adela suddenly, "you never told me
about No.  28."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me," I said, "I cannot bear to speak of 28."
</p>

<p>
"Why, was it even more unsuitable than the other
two?"
</p>

<p>
"I found, when I had done it six times, that its
object was stated to be, '<i>To remove double chin.</i>'  That,
however, was not the real effect.  And so I
crossed out the false comment and wrote the true
one in its place."
</p>

<p>
"And what is that?" asked Adela.
</p>

<p>
"'<i>To remove the hook,</i>'" I said gloomily.
</p>

<h3>
CROQUET
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
PROLOGUE
</p>

<p>
"I hear you're very good at croquet," said my
hostess.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," I said modestly.  (The fact is I can
beat them all at home.)
</p>

<p>
"We have the North Rutland champion staying
with us.  He's very keen on a game.  Now then,
how can we manage?"
</p>

<p>
This was terrible.  I must put it off somehow.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Is</i> there a north to Rutland," I began
argumentatively.  "I always thought&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I see.  He shall play with Jane against you
and Miss Middleton.  By the way, let me introduce
you all."
</p>

<p>
We bowed to each other for a bit, and then I had
another shock.  The N.R. champion's mallet was
bound with brass at each end (in case he wanted to
hit backwards suddenly) and had a silver plate on it.
Jane's had the brass only.  It was absurd that they
should play together.
</p>

<p>
I drew Miss Middleton on one side.
</p>

<p>
"I say," I began nervously, "I'm frightfully
sorry, but I quite forgot to bring my mallet.  Will
it matter very much?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't one either."
</p>

<p>
"You know, when my man was packing my bag,
I particularly said to him, 'Now, don't forget to put
in a mallet.'  He said, 'Shall I put the spare one in
too, sir, because the best one's sprung a bit?'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've never had one of my own.  I suppose
when one is really good&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, to tell you the truth, I've never
had one either.  We're fairly in for it now."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, we'll amuse ourselves somehow, I expect."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm quite looking forward to it."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER I
</p>

<p>
They kicked off from the summer-house end, and,
after jockeying for the start a bit, the N.R. champion
got going.  He went very slowly but very surely.  I
watched anxiously for ten minutes, expecting my
turn every moment.  After a quarter of an hour I
raised my hat and moved away.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we sit down?" I said to Miss Middleton.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be in the way if we sit down here,
sha'n't we?"
</p>

<p>
"Outside that chalk line we're safe?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I suppose so."
</p>

<p>
We moved outside and sat down on the grass.
</p>

<p>
"I never even had a chalk line," I said mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"It's much more fun without."
</p>

<p>
"You know," I went on, "I can beat them all at
home.  Why even Wilfrid&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's just the same with me," said Miss Middleton.
"Hilda did win once by a frightful fluke, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But this is quite different.  At home it would be
considered jolly bad form to go on all this time."
</p>

<p>
"One would simply go in and leave them," said
Miss Middleton.
</p>

<p>
"You know, it's awful fun at home.  The lawn
goes down in terraces, and if you hit the other person's
ball hard enough you can get it right down to the
bottom; and it takes at least six to get back on the
green again."
</p>

<p>
Miss Middleton gurgled to herself.
</p>

<p>
"We've got a stream ... round our lawn," she
said, in gasps.  "It's such a joke ... and
once ... when Hilda..."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER II
</p>

<p>
"May I call you 'Mary?'" I said; "we're still here."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we have known each other a long time,
certainly," said Miss Middleton.  "I think you
might."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much."
</p>

<p>
"What hoop is he at?"
</p>

<p>
"He's just half-way."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose, when he's finished, then, Jane does it
all?"
</p>

<p>
"It practically comes to that.  I believe, as a
matter of form, I am allowed a shot in between."
</p>

<p>
"That won't make any difference, will it?"
</p>

<p>
"No...."
</p>

<p>
"It's awfully hot, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes....  Do you bicycle much?"
</p>

<p>
"No....  Do you?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I generally sleep in the afternoons."
</p>

<p>
"Much the best thing to do.  Good-night."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER III
</p>

<p>
"Wake up," I said.  "You've been asleep for
hours.  Jane is playing now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm so sorry," said Mary, still with her eyes
closed.  "Then I missed your turn.  Was it a good
one?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely splendid.  I had a very long shot,
and hit the champion.  Then I took my mallet in
both hands, brought it well over the shoulder&mdash;are
you allowed to do that, by the way?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's hockey where you mustn't."
</p>

<p>
"And croqueted him right down to the house&mdash;over
beds, through bushes, across paths&mdash;the
longest ball I've ever driven."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you didn't make him very cross.  You
see, he may not be used to our game."
</p>

<p>
"Cross?  My dear girl, he was fairly chuckling
with delight.  Told me I'd missed the rest
of my turn.  It seems that if you go over two beds,
and across more than one path, you miss the rest of
your turn.  Did you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I did really, but I'd forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"And here I am again.  Jane will be even
longer.  He's lying on the grass, and taking sights for
her just now....  Why didn't you answer my last
letter?"
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER IV
</p>

<p>
"It's this passion for games," I said, waking up
suddenly, "which has made us Englishmen what we
are.  Here we have a hot July afternoon, when all
Nature is at peace, and the foreigner is taking his
siesta.  And what do we do?  How do we English
men and women spend this hot afternoon?  Why,
immediately after lunch, in one case even before the
meal has been digested, we rush off to take part in
some violent game like croquet.  Hour after hour
the play goes on relentlessly; there is no backing
out on our part, no pleading for just five minutes in
which to get our wind.  No, we bear our part
manfully, and&mdash;&mdash;  Are you awake by any chance, or am
I wasting all this?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I'm awake," said Mary, opening her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What years I have known you!  Do you remember
those days when we used to paddle together&mdash;the
mixed paddling at Brighton?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes.  And your first paint-box."
</p>

<p>
"And your doll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And the pony&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And the&mdash;good-night."
</p>

<p>
"G'night."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER XVIII
</p>

<p>
"But how absurd," said Mary, "when we've only
just met."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but come; it was about two years ago that
you let me call you 'Mary.'"
</p>

<p>
"True," said Mary thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"And you can't say we aren't suited to one
another.  We both play without the chalk line."
</p>

<p>
"So we do.  Yet ... Oh, I can't say all at once.
Give me a little time."
</p>

<p>
"I'll give you three of Jane's hoops.  That's
about six months."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER XX
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-eight," said the North Rutland
champion.  "That's what I won the championship
by, I remember."
</p>

<p>
"It's a good winning score," I said.  "Do they
play much in North Rutland?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it's been very slow for you and Miss
Middleton," said Jane.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly slow," I said.
</p>

<p>
"We've been talking a lot of nonsense," explained
Miss Middleton.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly nonsense," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was," said Miss Middleton, "you know it
was."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it was," I sighed.  "Well, we'll try
again to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Right," said the champion.  "But I shall use
my other mallet."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0503"></a></p>

<h3>
GARDENING
</h3>

<p>
There may be gardeners who can appear to be
busy all the year round&mdash;doing even in the
winter their little bit under glass.  But for myself
I wait reverently until the twenty-second of March
is here.  Then, spring having officially arrived, I
step out on to the lawn, and summon my head-gardener.
</p>

<p>
"James," I say, "the winter is over at last.
What have we got in that big brown-looking bed in
the middle there?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," he says, "we don't seem to have
anything, do we, like?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps there's something down below that
hasn't pushed through yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe there is."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you knew more about it," I say
angrily; "I want to bed out the macaroni there.
Have we got a spare bed, with nothing going on
underneath?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, sir.  Shall I dig 'em up and have
a look?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, perhaps you'd better," I say.
</p>

<p>
Between ourselves, James is a man of no initiative.
He has to be told everything.
</p>

<p>
However, mention of him brings me to my first
rule for young gardeners&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
  Never sow Spring Onions and New Potatoes in the<br>
  same bed<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I did this by accident last year.  The fact is,
when the onions were given to me I quite thought
they were young daffodils; a mistake anyone might
make.  Of course, I don't generally keep daffodils
and potatoes together; but James swore that the
hard round things were tulip bulbs.  It is perfectly
useless to pay your head-gardener half-a-crown a
week if he doesn't know the difference between
potatoes and tulip bulbs.  Well, anyhow, there they
were in the herbaceous border together, and they
grew up side by side; the onions getting stronger
every day and the potatoes more sensitive.  At last,
just when they were ripe for picking, I found that the
young onions had actually brought tears to the eyes
of the potatoes&mdash;to such an extent that the latter
were too damp for baking or roasting, and had
to be mashed.  Now, as everybody knows, mashed
potatoes are beastly.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
THE RHUBARB BORDER
</p>

<p>
gives me more trouble than all the rest of the garden.
I started it a year ago with the idea of keeping the
sun off the young carnations.  It acted excellently,
and the complexion of the flowers was improved
tenfold.  Then one day I discovered James busily
engaged in pulling up the rhubarb.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" I cried.  "Do you want
the young carnations to go all brown?"
</p>

<p>
"I was going to send some in to the cook," he
grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"To the cook!  What do you mean?  Rhubarb
isn't a vegetable."
</p>

<p>
"No, it's a fruit."
</p>

<p>
I looked at James anxiously.  He had a large hat
on, and the sun couldn't have got to the back of his
neck.
</p>

<p>
"My dear James," I said, "I don't pay you
half-a-crown a week for being funny.  Perhaps we had
better make it two shillings in future."
</p>

<p>
However, he persisted in his theory that in
the spring people stewed rhubarb in tarts and
ate it!
</p>

<p>
Well, I have discovered since that this is actually
so.  People really do grow it in their gardens, not
with the idea of keeping the sun off the young
carnations but under the impression that it is a fruit.
Consequently, I have found it necessary to adopt a firm
line with my friends' rhubarb.  On arriving at any
house for a visit, the first thing I say to my host is,
"May I see your rhubarb bed?  I have heard such a
lot about it."
</p>

<p>
"By all means," he says, feeling rather flattered,
and leads the way into the garden.
</p>

<p>
"What a glorious sunset," I say, pointing to the west.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it," he says, turning round; and then I
surreptitiously drop a pint of weed-killer on the bed.
</p>

<p>
Next morning I get up early and paint the roots of
the survivors with iodine.
</p>

<p>
Once my host, who for some reason had got up
early too, discovered me.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Just painting the roots with iodine," I said, "to
prevent the rhubarb falling out."
</p>

<p>
"To prevent what?"
</p>

<p>
"To keep the green fly away," I corrected myself.
"It's the new French intensive system."
</p>

<p>
But he was suspicious, and I had to leave two or
three stalks untreated.  We had those for lunch that
day.  There was only one thing for a self-respecting
man to do.  I obtained a large plateful of the weed
and emptied the sugar basin and the cream jug over
it.  Then I took a mouthful of the pastry, gave a little
start, and said, "Oh, is this rhubarb?  I'm sorry, I
didn't know."  Whereupon I pushed my plate away
and started on the cheese.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
ASPARAGUS
</p>

<p>
Asparagus wants watching very carefully.  It
requires to be tended like a child.  Frequently, I wake
up in the middle of the night and wonder if James
has remembered to put the hot-water bottle in the
asparagus bed.  Whenever I get up to look I find
that he has forgotten.
</p>

<p>
He tells me to-day that he is beginning to think
that the things which are coming up now are not
asparagus after all, but young hyacinths.  This is
very annoying.  I am inclined to fancy that James
is not the man he was.  For the sake of his reputation
in the past I hope he is not.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
POTTING OUT
</p>

<p>
I have spent a busy morning potting out the
nasturtiums.  We have them in three qualities&mdash;mild,
medium and full.  Nasturtiums are extremely
peppery flowers, and take offence so quickly that the
utmost tact is required to pot them successfully.  In
a general way all the red or reddish flowers should be
potted as soon as they are old enough to stand it, but
it is considered bad form among horticulturists to pot
the white.
</p>

<p>
James has been sowing the roses.  I wanted all the
pink ones in one bed, and all the yellow ones in
another, and so on; but James says you never can
tell for certain what colour a flower is going to be
until it comes up.  Of course, any fool could tell
then.
</p>

"You should go by the picture on the outside of
the packet," I said.
</p>

<p>
"They're very misleading," said James.
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow, they must be all brothers in the
same packet."
</p>

<p>
"You might have a brother with red hair," says
James.

<p>
I hadn't thought of that.

GRAFTING
</p>

<p>
Grafting is when you try short approaches over the
pergola in somebody's else's garden, and break the
best tulip.  You mend it with a ha'penny stamp
and hope that nobody will notice; at any rate not
until you have gone away on the Monday.  Of course
in your own garden you never want to graft.
</p>

<p>
I hope at some future time to be allowed&mdash;even
encouraged&mdash;to refer to such things as the most
artistic way to frame cucumbers, how to stop
tomatoes blushing (the hom[oe]opathic method of
putting them next to the French beans is now
discredited), and spring fashions in fox gloves.  But
for the moment I have said enough.  The great
thing to remember in gardening is that flowers, fruits
and vegetables alike can only be cultivated with
sympathy.  Special attention should be given to
backward and delicate plants.  They should be
encouraged to make the most of themselves.  Never
forget that flowers, like ourselves, are particular
about the company they keep.  If a hyacinth droops
in the celery bed, put it among the pansies.
</p>

<p>
But above all, mind, a firm hand with the rhubarb.

CHAPTER II
</p>

<p>
"You know," I said to Thomas in the train, "I
have played a little on a very small island off the
coast of Scotland, but it was such a very small island
that we never used a driver at all, or&mdash;what's that
other thing called?&mdash;a brassy.  We should have been
into the sea in no time.  But I rather fancy myself
with a putter."
</p>

<p>
"You might go round with a putter to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I might, but I sha'n't.  I expect to use the
wooden clubs with great ease and dexterity.  And I
think you will find that I can do some business with
the mashie.  What's a niblick?"
</p>

<p>
"The thing you get out of bunkers with."
</p>

<p>
"Then I sha'n't want that."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER III
</p>

<p>
The fateful moment arrived.  Thomas presented
me with a ball called the Colonel, and a caddie offered
me Thomas's brother's driver.  He also asked me
what sort of tee I should like.
</p>

<p>
I leant upon my club and looked at him.  Then I
turned to Thomas.
</p>

<p>
"Our young friend Hector," I said, "is becoming
technical.  Will you explain?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, do you want a high or a low one?"
</p>

<p>
"I want to hit this Colonel ball very hard in the
direction of that flag.  What do you recommend?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's just as you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I think a medium one.  Slow to medium."
</p>

<p>
The preliminaries being arranged, I proceeded to
address the ball.  My own instinct was to take the
address as read and get to business as soon as
possible, but in the presence of an expert like Hector
I did not dare to omit the trimmings.  As it was,
after every waggle I felt less and less like hitting the
Colonel.  When at last I did let fly it was with
feelings of relief that I discovered, on returning an
eye to the spot, that the tee was indeed empty.  I
shaded my eyes and gazed into the middle distance.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Thomas, "it's more to the right."  He
indicated a spot in the foreground, about ten yards
E.N.E.  "There you are."
</p>

<p>
"That isn't <i>my</i> ball."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Hector, grinning.
</p>

<p>
"May I have it back?"
</p>

<p>
Thomas laughed and smote his own into the blue.
"You go on from there," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I'm still aiming at the same flag?"
</p>

<p>
"Go on, you ass."
</p>

<p>
I went on.  The ball again rolled ten yards to
the east.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why we're going in this direction,"
I said.  "If I get much further east I shall have to
send back Bartlett.  You know, I don't believe the
Colonel is taking this seriously.  He doesn't seem to
me to be trying at all.  Has he ever been round the
course before?"
</p>

<p>
"Never.  He's quite new to it."
</p>

<p>
"There you are.  He'll come down at the ditch for
a certainty."
</p>

<p>
I played my third.  A third time we went ten yards
to the east&mdash;well, perhaps with a touch of north in it
again.  And this time Hector gave a sudden snort of
laughter.
</p>

<p>
I leant upon my club, and stared him into gravity.
Then I took Thomas by the coat and led him on one
side.
</p>

<p>
"There are, Thomas," I said, "other things than golf."
</p>

<p>
"There are," he agreed.
</p>

<p>
"A man may fail temporarily at the game and yet
not be wholly despicable."
</p>

<p>
"True."
</p>

<p>
"He may, for instance, be able to dance the
<i>pavane</i> with grace and distinction."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so."
</p>

<p>
"Well then, <i>will</i> you take this giggling child away
and explain to him that I am not such an ass as I
appear?  Tell him that the intellectuals of Brook
Green think highly of my mental powers.  Assure
him that in many of the best houses at Wandsworth
Common I am held to be an amusing raconteur.
Remind him of my <i>villanelle</i> 'To Autumn.'  For
heaven's sake make him understand that my reputation
does not stand or fall with my ability to use this
brassy thing.  I'm not a golf professional."
</p>

<p>
Thomas allowed himself to smile.  "I will tell
him," he said, "that you are not a golf professional."
</p>

<p>
We veered right round to the east with my fourth
and then I became desperate.
</p>

<p>
"Why," I shouted, "do I hit the ball with a
ridiculous club like this?  I could send it farther
with a cricket bat.  I could push it straighter with a
billiard cue.  Where's that bag?  I am going to
have a lucky dip."
</p>

<p>
I dipped, and came up with what Thomas called a
cleek.  "Now then," I said.  I didn't stop to address
the Colonel, I simply lashed at him.  He flew along
the ground at a terrific pace.
</p>

<p>
"Well kept down," said Thomas admiringly.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" I cried, "that's never going to stop.
See how he flies along ... now he breasts the slope
... look, he is taking the water jump....  Ah, he
has crossed his legs, he's down."
</p>

<p>
"This," I said to Thomas as we walked after the
Colonel, "is golf.  A glorious game."
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense," I said to Thomas, "they put in
comic papers about golf.  All that about digging
up the turf! ... and missing the ball! ... and
breaking the clubs!  I mean, I simply don't see how
one <i>could</i>!  Let's see, I've played four, haven't I?"
</p>

<p>
"Five," said Thomas.  "What I am wondering,"
he added, "is why you should have been afraid of
using any club in your small island off the coast
of Scotland."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
CHAPTER IV
</p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Twenty Strokes After</i>
</p>

<p>
"The green, the green," I shouted joyfully, in the
manner of the ancient Greeks, though I was only on
the edge of it.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Thomas.
</p>

<p>
I took a careful aim and put the white down.
</p>

<p>
"You see," I said carelessly, leaning on my putter.

<h3>
STUMP CRICKET
</h3>

<p>
April will soon be here," said Miss Middleton,
with a sigh of happiness.
</p>

<p>
"Bless it," I agreed.  "My favourite month.
Twelve," I added conversationally, "is my lucky
number, and Thursday the day of the week on which I
do least work.  When next the twelfth of April
falls on a Thursday, which may not be for centuries,
look out.  Something terrific will happen."
</p>

<p>
"It's about now that one begins to wonder if one is
in form, or likely to be."
</p>

<p>
"Just about now," I agreed.  "I always say that
when the draw is announced for the semi-finals of the
English Cup, in which, of course, I take not the
slightest interest whatever, and in fact hardly know
what teams are left in for it, though I must say I hope
Southampton wins this year, because, after all, Fry
did play for them once, but they'll have a bit of a job
to beat the Wolves you know&mdash;and then there's
Newcastle and Fulham after that, and of course, you
can't be ..."
</p>

<p>
"I'm tired of that sentence," said Miss Middleton.
</p>

<p>
"So was I.  I only wanted to make it clear that I
have no use for these spectacular gladiatorial
combats.  Give me cricket, the game of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Miss Middleton did not appear to be listening.
</p>

<p>
"Do you bowl as fast and as good a length as you
talk?" she asked thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"No.  More swerve perhaps.  And I bowl with
my head a good deal."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Quite different.  Well, then, will you
coach me this spring?  Do, there's a dear."
</p>

<p>
"I should love to.  I know all the things to say."
</p>

<p>
She got up excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"Come along then.  I've got the rippingest bat.
But you must promise not to bowl too fast."
</p>

<p>
I had said that I knew all the things to say, but as
a matter of fact there is only one thing to say: "You
should have come out to 'er, sir."  (Or, I suppose, in
Miss Middleton's case, "You should have come out to
him, madam.")  It's a silly remark to make, because
it is just what one is always doing.  At school
I could come out to anything that was straight and
not too high; the difficulty lay in staying in.
Nobody ever told me how to do that.
</p>

<p>
Miss Middleton led the way to a walled-in tennis
lawn, which lay next to the broccoli tops and things,
and was kept away from it by only six feet of brick.
If it had simply been a question of cabbage I should
have said nothing, but there would be grapes there
too.
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Miss Middleton.  "But we must
play against a wall.  Don't bowl too much to leg."
</p>

<p>
I hadn't bowled since October the Fourth.  The
first post-October ball was a trifle over-pitched, and a
little too much to the right.  All the same I was just
saying, "You should have come out to that one,"
when there was a crash from the direction of long-on.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, I didn't know you were so good.
Was that the grapes?"
</p>

<p>
"How awful!  Yes.  It simply seemed to fly off
the bat.  I did ask you not to bowl there, didn't I?"
</p>

<p>
She looked so penitent that I had to comfort her.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," I said consolingly.  "I had a man
there.  You would have been out all the way.  Besides,"
I went on, "a little air will do the grapes good.
They stay all the time in one hot room, and then when
they go out into the cold, they don't muffle up, and
the natural consequence is&mdash;&mdash;  Or am I thinking of
influenza?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  We must remember not to do it
again, that's all.  Give me some to cut."
</p>

<p>
There are several ways of cutting.  For myself, I
was taught to cut "square" with the left leg across
and "late" with the right, the consequence being
that I can do neither.  W.G. (to work downwards)
generally uses the fore-arm for the stroke, Ranji the
wrist.  Miss Middleton keeps both feet together and
puts her whole body into it; and the direction in
which the ball travels is towards long-on.  There was
another crash.
</p>

<p>
"Golf is your game," I said admiringly.  "You
lay it dead on the greenhouse every time."
</p>

<p>
"I say, what <i>shall</i> we do?  Father will be furious."
</p>

<p>
I looked at my watch.
</p>

<p>
"I can just catch the three-twenty-five," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't be a coward, when it's all your fault for
bowling so badly."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps the glass is insured," I suggested.  "It
is generally."
</p>

<p>
"It's insured against hail," she said doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
I looked at the sky.  It was one of the most
beautiful blues I have seen.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Miss Middleton sadly.
</p>

<p>
"It will be a point for lawyers to argue, I fancy,
what is actually meant by hail.  You would probably
define it at once as aqueous vapour cooled
down in the atmosphere to the freezing point of
water."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Perhaps I should."
</p>

<p>
"But 'hail' here obviously has a wider significance.
I take it to mean 'anything that descends
suddenly from the clouds.'  I haven't 'Williams on
Real Property' with me, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come on," said Miss Middleton, "let's say it
does mean that.  And could you, <i>please</i>, keep them
a bit more on the off?"
</p>

<p>
"It's no good my keeping them there if you don't."
</p>

<p>
The worst of coaching&mdash;I speak now as an expert&mdash;is
that it is so difficult to know what to say when
a lady whirls her bat twice round her head, gives a
little shriek, gets the ball on the knee, and says,
"What ought I to have done then?"  The only
answer I could think of was "Not that."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you knew all about coaching," she said
scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"But, you see, it depends on what you were wanting
to do," I said meekly.  "If it was a drive you should
have come out to it more, and if it was a cut you
should have come down on it; while if it was a
Highland fling you lacked <i>abandon</i>, and if you were
killing a wasp&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A good coach would know what was the best
thing to do with that particular ball, wouldn't he?
And that's just what he would tell you."
</p>

<p>
"He wouldn't know," I said modestly.  "You
don't often meet that sort of ball in good cricket."
</p>

<p>
"No, I suppose not.  That's why I didn't know
what to do, I expect.  You know I generally know
exactly what to do, only I can't do it."
</p>

<p>
"Is that really so?" I cried excitedly.  "Why,
then, of course, you ought to coach <i>me</i>!"
</p>

<p>
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
We had a very jolly afternoon.  I fancy I shall be
in some form this year.  Miss Middleton is one of the
best bowlers I have seen, but I brought off some
beautiful shots.  I wanted some tea badly afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"What glorious days we have now," said Miss
Middleton's mother, as she handed me a cup.
</p>

<p>
"Glorious," said Miss Middleton's father.
</p>

<p>
"H'm, yes," I said doubtfully.  "But you know
I'm afraid it won't last.  It's beginning to look rather
like&mdash;like hail."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Miss Middleton.  "We both thought so."
</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Ball,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That innocent tears (the first for years) rolled out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the eyes of all.<br>
  Partikerlarly out of those of Etukishook, Gaukrodger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J. C. Clegg, Sir Fortescue Flannery, and the<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardinal Merry del Val.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I called for a pen and paper, and I wrote to<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the King, "Dear King,<br>

<h3>
SHOPPING
</h3>

<p>
"If you <i>should</i> happen to be in Regent Street
tomorrow at four" (ran the assignation), "just
where what's the name of the street comes into it,
and a lady in a very pretty new mauve coat and skirt
bows to you, raise your hat and say 'Crisis' and she
will let you help her with her shopping."
</p>

<p>
My guess at the name of the street was successful.
I raised my hat and said "Good-afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"But you had to say 'Crisis,'" said Miss Middleton.
"That's the password."
</p>

<p>
"I can't.  I've sworn I'll never say it again.  I
took a most fearful oath.  Several people heard me
taking it, and swooned."
</p>

<p>
"But how do I know you're the right one if
you don't say it?  Well, I suppose I shall have
to let you come.  I've just lost mother; she
went in at the silver department and out at the
art fabrics&mdash;like people when they can't pay for
their hansoms."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's bad.  'The accused, who appeared to
feel her position acutely, gave a false address.'  What
are you going to buy?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I thought I'd just help you get <i>your</i>
presents first."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not giving any this Christmas.  I gave a lot
only a year ago."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but haven't they paid you any wages since then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a few trifling sums, only&mdash;&mdash;  Quick, there's
your mother!"  I pulled Miss Middleton hastily
into the nearest shop and shut the door.
</p>

<p>
"What fun!" she said breathlessly.  "Mother
<i>loves</i> hide-and-seek."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Middleton hurried past, covered with parcels,
and dived into another door.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite safe now," I said.  "Let's go and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What can I have the pleasure of showing you?"
said a soothing voice at our backs.
</p>

<p>
We turned round in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;we only just&mdash;let me see, <i>what</i> was it you
wanted?" said Miss Middleton to me.
</p>

<p>
"I don't really want anything.  I was going
to help you buy one of those&mdash;you know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I've got that.  I know there was
<i>something</i> you said you wanted very much."
</p>

<p>
"Probably tea."
</p>

<p>
"Tiaras," explained Miss Middleton hastily.  "Of
course."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, madam," said the shopwalker.  "If
you will just sit down," he continued, leading us to a
little room out of the main stream of shoppers, "I
will send somebody to attend you."
</p>

<p>
We sat down mechanically.  I leant my stick
against a showcase and balanced my hat on the top
of it.
</p>

<p>
"Now you've done it," I said.  "How many
tiaras shall we have?  I've got nearly four
pounds."
</p>

<p>
"We needn't have any.  We can say we don't
much care about their selection."
</p>

<p>
"Or that we wanted one specially built for us."
</p>

<p>
"One goes into dozens of shops without buying
<i>anything</i>," said Miss Middleton cheerily.
</p>

<p>
"I never do," I replied gloomily.  "Look out,
here he is."
</p>

<p>
An attendant advanced briskly towards us.  I
put my hands in my pockets and tried to count my
money.
</p>

<p>
"Tiaras, madam?  Certainly.  About what price?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell him about three pounds eight and six,"
I whispered to Miss Middleton.  "Three pounds
nine," I corrected, as I ran another sixpence to
ground.
</p>

<p>
"Here is a beautiful one at two hundred and fifty
pounds."
</p>

<p>
"Too much," I prompted softly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," broke in Miss Middleton brightly, "I'm
so sorry&mdash;such a silly mistake!  We wanted
neck-chains, not tiaras!  Barbara has a tiara already,
hasn't she?" she appealed to me.
</p>

<p>
"Two," I said quickly.  "If not three."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so sorry," said Miss Middleton, with a
dazzling smile.  "The first gentleman must have
misunderstood.  Of course we gave her a tiara last
year."
</p>

<p>
The man was disappointed; I saw that.  But the
smile melted him, and he went off in all friendliness.
</p>

<p>
"Tiara doesn't sound very much like neck-chain,"
I remarked after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't you think so?  It depends how you
say it.  Like Beauchamp and Cholmondeley."
</p>

<p>
"And what is it when pronounced properly?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a chain that hangs round your neck, and
when you don't quite know what to say to anybody
you play with it carelessly.  Same as men smoking
cigarettes, only better for you."
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Well, here we have a hundred of the best."
</p>

<p>
The attendant got to business at once.
</p>

<p>
"This one," he said, holding up rather a jolly one,
"comes out at ten guineas."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him," I whispered to Miss Middleton, "that
we've only come out with three."
</p>

<p>
"That's <i>very</i> pretty," she said.  "Are those moon-stones?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madam.  The fashionable stone this year."
</p>

<p>
"It's more for next year that we want it."
</p>

<p>
"I should say this season.  I don't think you will
find a prettier one than this, madam."
</p>

<p>
"It's very sweet.  But aren't they unlucky, unless
you happen to have been born in the right month?"  She
turned to me.  "When is Barbara's birthday?"
</p>

<p>
"May," I said unhesitatingly.  "I mean March."
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow," said Miss Middleton.  "I know it's
wrong for moonstones, because I was thinking of
giving her some two years ago, and it had to "be opals
instead."
</p>

<p>
"We both thought of it," I said.
</p>

<p>
Miss Middleton looked at me so admiringly that I
began to get reckless.
</p>

<p>
"Besides, we don't know the size of her neck," I
went on.  "And she never smokes&mdash;I mean she
never doesn't know what to say to anybody.  So I
think we should be making a mistake if we gave her
this.  I do indeed.  Now if it had been anybody else
but Barbara&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The man looked from one to the other of us in
bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"If you could show us some hatpins instead?"
said Miss Middleton hurriedly, before he could open his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
"This is excellent," I said, as he retired in
confusion; "we're working down well.  All we've got
to do now is to wait till he comes back and then say
that we're sorry but we meant hairpins.  With
hair-pins you're practically there."
</p>

<p>
"Supposing they only had gold ones?"
</p>

<p>
"Then we should point out that they wouldn't go
with Barbara's curiously-coloured hair.  You leave
this to me.  I can finish it off now on my head.
At the same time I'm sorry I'm not going to spend
<i>anything</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you are," said Miss Middleton.
"You're going to give me and mother tea."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am," I agreed.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
After tea I went back to the shop by myself.
</p>

<p>
"I want," I said "a trifle for about three pounds.
A moonstone pendant or something.  Yes, that's very
sweet.  No, I'll take it with me."
</p>

<p>
They packed it in a pretty little box for me, and
I'm going to send it to Miss Middleton on the
twenty-fourth.  I am putting in a card with the words "From
Barbara" on it.  As I said, I am not giving any
presents myself this year, but I do think that Barbara
should repay at least some of the kindnesses which
have been showered upon her so wantonly.

<h3>
CHESS
</h3>

<p>
(The author cannot lay claim to any great technical
knowledge of chess, but he fancies that he understands the
spirit of the game.  He feels that, after the many poems
on the Boat Race, a few bracing lines on the Inter-University
Chess Match would be a welcome change.)
</p>

<p class="poem">
  This is the ballad of Edward Bray,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain of Catherine's, Cambridge Blue&mdash;<br>
  Oh, no one ever had just his way<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of huffing a bishop with KB2!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The day breaks fine, and the evenings brings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worthy foe in the Oxford man&mdash;<br>
  A great finesser with pawns and things,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But quick in the loose when the game began.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The board was set, and the rivals tossed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fortune (alas!) was Oxford's friend.<br>
  "Tail," cried Edward, and Edward lost;<br>
  So Oxford played from the fireplace end.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We hold our breath, for the game's begun&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, who so gallant as Edward Bray!<br>
  He's taken a bishop from KQ1,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ruffed it&mdash;just in the Cambridge way!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then Oxford castles his QB knight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He follows the old, old Oxford groove;<br>
  Though never a gambit saw the light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's able to cope with Edward's move).<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The game went on, and the game was fast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Oxford huffed and his King was crowned;<br>
  The exchange was lost, and a pawn was passed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the table a knight was found!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then Oxford chuckled; but Edward swore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horrible, horrible oath swore he;<br>
  And landed him one on the QB4,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And followed it up with an RQ3.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Time was called; with an air of pride<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to his feet rose Edward Bray.<br>
  "Marker, what of the score?" he cried.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What of the battle I've won this day?"<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The score was counted; and Bray had won<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By two in honours, and four by tricks,<br>
  And half of a bishop that came undone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all of a bishop on KQ6.<br>
</p>

<p class="thought">
  * * * * * *<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then here's to Chess: and a cheer again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the man who fought on an April day<br>
  With never a thought of sordid gain!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England's proud of you, Edward Bray!<br>

<h3>
PROGRESSIVE BRIDGE
</h3>

<p>
There were twelve tables numbered A, B, C,
up to&mdash;well, twelve of them, and I started at
E, because my name is Ernest.  Our host arranged
us and, of course, he may have had quite another
scheme in his mind.  If so, it was an extraordinary
coincidence that my partner's name was Ethel.
She herself swore it was Millicent, but I doubt if one
can trust a woman in these matters.  She looked just
like an Ethel.  I had never seen her before, I shall
never see her again, but she will always be Ethel to
me.
</p>

<p>
There is only one rule at progressive bridge, and
that is, if you lose you go to the next table, and if
you win you stay where you are.  In any case you
get a fresh partner each time.  That being so, it
seemed hardly worth while to ask Ethel what she
discarded from.  As it happened, though, she
began it.
</p>

<p>
"I discard from strength," she said.
</p>

<p>
"So do I," I agreed gladly.  We already had a lot
in common.  "Great strength returns the penny," I
added.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Moderate strength rings the bell.  It's a sort of
formula I say to myself, and brings luck.  May I
play to hearts?"
</p>

<p>
Ethel discarded a small heart on the first round of
clubs, and a small club on the first round of hearts.
After which, systematically and together, we
discarded from great weakness.  What with the revoke
and other things they scored hundreds and thousands
that game.
</p>

<p>
"You know, where providence goes wrong," I
said, "is in over-estimating our skill.  Providence
thinks too highly of us.  It thinks that if it gives us
a knave and two tens between us we can get a grand
slam."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and I think&mdash;I think, perhaps, that just
the least little bit it underrates Dorothy's abilities."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?" I said.  Dorothy was the person who
had just taken two hundred and ninety-eight off us.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  You see Dorothy has played before, and
I don't think providence knew."
</p>

<p>
"It rather looks like that."
</p>

<p>
"Mind," said Ethel graciously, "I don't blame
providence for not knowing."
</p>

<p>
Dorothy laughed, and cut for me.  I dealt myself
three aces, and went no trumps.  To my surprise
Dorothy's partner doubled, and led the ace of
hearts.
</p>

<p>
"One moment," I said, and I took it up, and looked
at the back of it.  Then I looked at the back of my
own ace of hearts.  Then I looked at the front of it
again, and swore very softly, and played it.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry," I apologised at the end of the
game.  "I had a wolf in sheep's clothing, an ass in a
lion's skin.  You saw me play the three of hearts.
Well, do you know&mdash;it's very sad&mdash;he actually
pretended to be the ace.  Hid his head behind one
card, and his feet behind another, and only&mdash;well, I
thought it was the ace."
</p>

<p>
At the end of the round Ethel and I moved on.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," I said to Dorothy, "I like watching
you play.  If you wait here I shall be round again
soon."
</p>

<p>
My next partner was called Aggie.  Ethel
addressed her as Mary, but she was much too lively for
Mary.  I had never seen her before, I shall never see
her again, but she will always be Aggie to me.
</p>

<p>
She began at once:
</p>

<p>
"I discard from weakness, partner.  I like hearts
led, I never go spades on my own, I live on tapioca
and toadstools, and the consequence was&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's the same with me," I said, "except about
tapioca.  I don't like tapioca.  In fact I
always&mdash;er&mdash;discard from tapioca.  Otherwise we agree.  It's
your deal.  Now," I said to Ethel, "we shall see
what providence thinks of our comparative merits."
</p>

<p>
Providence made no mistake.  In the whole round
my partner and I scored once only.  <i>Chicane</i> in
spades.  I moved on to G.  I should never see Ethel
again.
</p>

<p>
"I always play the Canadian discard," said Violet,
"and I like spades led."
</p>

<p>
I need hardly say that Aggie, whom Ethel called
Mary, spoke of Violet as Diana.  But she looked
much more like Violet, and she will always be Violet
to me.  I had never seen her before though, and I
shall never see her again.
</p>

<p>
"So do I," I said.  "Do you know Canada at all?
I always wish I had been there."
</p>

<p>
"I go a good deal to Switzerland," said Violet.
"Are you fond of bridge?"
</p>

<p>
"No, never; that is, I mean, 'Very.'  Shall we
cut?"
</p>

<p>
The "Canadian discard" hardly does itself justice
under that name.  It is no mere discard, but embraces
all the finer points of bridge.  It leads through
weakness, and blocks your partner's long suits, and
trumps his tricks; and, though I couldn't discover
any recognised system about it, revokes now and
then.  I, too, from tact or sympathy, or some such
motive, played the Canadian discard for all I was
worth.  We got to H without any difficulty....
</p>

<p>
J, K and L may be passed by, for nothing happened
there.  For some reason "I" was left out, or,
rather, run into J.  I cannot understand the point of
this.  To every man his table, and I feel convinced
that I should have done remarkably well at "I."  I
had been looking forward to it all the evening.  I
don't much care about betting, but I am prepared
to wager a hundred pounds that I should have got
a grand slam at "I."
</p>

<p>
It was somewhere down in the X's that I met
Maud.  I had been round I don't know how many
times, and was feeling quite giddy.  Alice, Elizabeth,
Iris, Mabel&mdash;they were all forgotten when I came to
play with Maud.  Hepzibah (on my right) called her
Millicent or something like that, but I knew really
that her name must be Maud.  I had never seen her
before, I shall never see her again, but she will
always be Maud to me.
</p>

<p>
"I discard from hearts," I said.  "I like my
weakest suit led, I have revoked three times this
evening, at table G on the right-hand side of the
fireplace I played the 'Canadian discard,' and I shall
never play it again, at K as you go round the lamp I
had four aces and my partner went spades, I've had
rotten luck all through, and I'm enjoying myself
very much.  Shall we be very cautious, or would you
like to play a dashing game?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let's dash," said Maud.
</p>

<p>
I dealt, and went no trumps on two aces.  To my
great surprise Hepzibah's partner doubled and led
the ace of clubs.
</p>

<p>
"One moment," I said, and I took it up and
looked at the back of it.  Then I looked at the back
of my own ace of clubs.  Then I looked at the front
of it, and swore very softly, and played it.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very sorry," I began at the end of the game,
"but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Haven't we met before?" said Maud, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
I looked at her hard.  "By Jove!  Ethel!" I cried.
</p>

<p>
"My name's Millicent," said Maud, "and seeing
that we met for the first time a few hours ago&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you were my first partner, 'Ethel.'"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry.  Who is Ethel?"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," I apologised.  "But I
always call my first partner at progressive bridge
Ethel.  It's a sort of hobby with me."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Maud&mdash;I mean Ethel.  Well, I
suppose I must call her Millicent now.  Though I
had never seen her before, and shall never see her
again, she will always be Millicent to me.

<h3>
DRESSING UP
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
I. AT A PAGEANT
</p>

<p>
Our episode is the tenth and last and (I may add
unofficially) the most important.  The period
of it is 1750.  In order to lead up to it properly it
has been found necessary to start the first episode
at 53 B.C.  This gives the audience time to get
hungry for us.  "At last!" they say, when we come
on, "this <i>is</i> the end, Maria."
</p>

<p>
The Duchess of Kirkcudbright (N.B.) says that
they don't say that at all.  They say, "Why, Henry,
it's 1750!  I had no idea.  How the time flies when
you are enjoying yourself.  We <i>must</i> stay to the
end; a few minutes won't make any difference now,
and it's only cold mutton."
</p>

<p>
I must explain that it is the Duchess of Kirkcudbright
(N.B.)&mdash;and <i>do</i> remember the "N.B.," because
she is very particular about it&mdash;who in this episode
condescends to dance a minuet with me: that
stately old measure (if you don't trip over the
sand-hill opposite Block D.) which so delighted our
forefathers.  It is a very sad thing, but though the whole
pageant, as I have explained, hinges upon us, yet
our names and description do not appear upon the
programme.  We are put down briefly, and I think
libellously, as "Revellers."  However, we learnt
that we were really people of some position&mdash;right
in the smart set, by all accounts; so I decided to be
Lord Tunbridge Wells, and my partner the Duchess
of Kirkcudbright (N.B.).  That is just like her&mdash;to
be a whole county, when I am only a watering-place.
</p>

<p>
We are supposed to do the "revelling" as soon as
we come in.  As I lead my partner down the steps I
say to her, "Our revel, I think?" and she replies,
"Shall we revel, or shall we sit it out?"  After a
little discussion we decide to revel, partly because
there is nowhere to sit down, and partly because the
prompter has his eye on us.  Now I don't know what
your idea of revelling is, but mine would include at
the very least a small ginger ale and a slice of
seed-cake.  I mean, I don't think that would be
overdoing it at all.  But do you suppose we are allowed
this&mdash;or indeed anything?  Not likely.  And yet it
is just a little touch of that sort which gives
verisimilitude to a whole pageant.
</p>

<p>
Before we have really got through our revelling
the band strikes up, and suddenly we are all in our
places for the minuet.  Now, although you have
paid your two guineas like a man, and are sitting in
the very front row, you mustn't think we have
taken all this trouble of learning the minuet simply
to amuse you.  Not at all.  We are doing it for the
sake of King George the Second, no less; a command
performance.  And so, when we are all in a line, just
ready to start, and I whisper to my partner, "I say,
I'm awfully sorry, but I've forgotten the minuet.
Let's do the Lancers instead," she whispers back,
"Quick!  George is looking at me.  Is my patch
on straight?"  "No," I say.  "Now, don't forget
you have to smile all the time.  Hallo, we're off."
</p>

<p>
I am not going to describe the dance to you, because
it is too difficult.  But I may say briefly that
there's a whole lot of things you do with your feet,
and another whole lot with your hands; that you
have to sway your body about in an easy and
graceful manner; that you must keep one eye on the
ground to see that you don't fall over the sandhills,
and another eye on your partner to see that she is
doing it all right, and the two of you a joint eye on
everybody else to see that the affair is going
symmetrically.  And <i>then</i>&mdash;then comes the final
instruction: "Don't look anxious.  Smile, and seem to be
enjoying yourself."
</p>

<p>
So far I have resisted the inclination to smile.  The
fact is that when I cast aside my usual habiliments
and take upon me the personality of another I like
to do the thing thoroughly&mdash;to enter into the spirit
of the part.  Now I will put the case before you, and
you shall say whether I am not right.
</p>

<p>
Here we have, as I conceive the situation, a sprig
of the nobility, Tunbridge Wells.  He is a modest
young man, who spends most of his time at his lovely
Kentish seat, flanked by fine old forest trees&mdash;preferring
the quiet of the country to the noise and
bustle of London.
</p>

<p>
One day, however, he ventures up to town, and
looking in at his customary coffee-house is hailed by
an acquaintance.  Tunbridge Wells, I may mention,
is beautifully attired in a long blue coat, white satin
waistcoat, fancy breeches, with quaint designs
painted on them, silk stockings, and shoes which are
too small for him.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing to-night?" says his friend.
"Come down to Chelsea with me.  There's a grand
Venetian <i>fête</i> on, and old George will be there."
</p>

<p>
"Right," says Tunbridge Wells.
</p>

<p>
When they get to the gardens his friend takes him
aside.
</p>

<p>
"I say," he begins anxiously, "I hope you won't
mind, but the fact is that I've promised you shall
dance in a minuet to-night.  Old George particularly
wants to see one."
</p>

<p>
"But I simply couldn't," says Tunbridge Wells, in
alarm.  "Can't you get somebody else?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you must.  I've got you a jolly partner&mdash;the
Duchess of Kirkcudbright (N.B.).  You know
the minuet, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've learnt it; but I've very nearly forgotten
it again.  And my shoes are beastly uncomfortable.
Before the King too!  It's a bit steep, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Well then, you will.  Good man."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," cries Tunbridge Wells hastily, and leads
his friend aside under the trees.  "I say," he begins
mysteriously, "don't say anything, but&mdash;well, it's
rather awkward ... I may as well tell you
... these&mdash;er&mdash;these things are a bit tight.  They look
all right like this, you know, but when you bend
down&mdash;well, I mean I have to be jolly careful."
</p>

<p>
"I was just thinking how pretty they were.  A
beautiful thing, that," he adds, pointing to a crescent
moon in blue on Tunbridge Wells' left knee.
</p>

<p>
"Don't touch," says Wells in alarm, "it comes off
like anything.  I lost a dragon-fly only yesterday.
Well, you see how it is, old man.  But for them I
should have loved it.  Only ... I say, don't be a
fool....  Your servant, Duchess.  I was just
saying ... yes, I am devoted to it....  Yes....
Yes.  Let's see, it <i>is</i> the left foot, isn't it?
(Confound that idiot!)"
</p>

<p>
Now then, do you wonder that the poor fellow
looks anxious, or that I feel it my duty as a good
actor to look anxious too?
</p>

<p>
I have promised not to describe the whole minuet
to you, but I must mention one figure in it of which
I am particularly fond.  In this you rejoin your
partner after a long absence, and you have once more
her supporting hand to hold you up.  For some
hours previously you have been alone in the wild and
undulating open, tripping over molehills and falling
down ha-has; and it is very pleasant (especially
when your shoes fit you too soon) to get back to her
and pour all your troubles into her sympathetic ear.
It's a figure in which you stand on one foot each for
a considerable time, and paw the air with the others.
You preserve your balance better if you converse
easily and naturally.
</p>

<p>
"I nearly came a frightful purler just now; did
you see?"
</p>

<p>
"H'sh, not so loud.  Have you found mother
yet?  She's here to-day."
</p>

<p>
"One of my patches fell off.  I hope nobody
heard it."
</p>

<p>
"You've got a different wig to-day.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"It's greyer.  I had such a very anxious moment
yesterday.  You know that last bow at the end
where you go down and stay under water for about
five minutes?  Well, I really thought&mdash;however,
they didn't."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like you in this one.  It doesn't suit you
at all."
</p>

<p>
"So I thought at first.  But if you gaze at it very
earnestly for three hours, and then look up at the
ceiling, you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, there <i>is</i> mother.  Hold up."
</p>

<p>
"I fancy we have rather a good action in this
figure.  Do you think she's noticing it?  I hope
she knows that we <i>could</i> stand on one leg without
moving the other one at all.  I mean I don't want
her to think&mdash;&mdash;  Hallo, here we are.  Good-bye.  See
you again in the next figure but one."  And the
Duchess of Kirkcudbright (N.B.) trips off.
</p>

<p>
I put in the "N.B." because she is very
particular about it; and I say "trips" because I know
the ground.
</p>

<p class="t3">
II. AT A DANCE
</p>

<p>
"Then you really are coming?" said Queen Elizabeth,
as she gave me my third cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I really am," I sighed.
</p>

<p>
"What as?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know at all&mdash;something with a cold.  I
leave it to you, partner, only don't go a black
suit."
</p>

<p>
"What about Richelieu?"
</p>

<p>
"I should never be able to pronounce that," I
confessed.  "Besides, I always think that these
great scientists&mdash;I should say, philos&mdash;that is, of
course, that these generals&mdash;er, which room is the
encyclopædia in?"
</p>

<p>
"You might go as one of the kings of England.
Which is your favourite king?"
</p>

<p>
"William and Mary.  Now that <i>would</i> be an
original costume.  I should have&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be ridiculous.  Why not Henry VIII.?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I should get a lot of partners as
Henry VIII.?  Anyhow, I don't think it's a very
becoming figure."
</p>

<p>
"But you don't wear fancy dress simply because
it's becoming."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that is rather the point to settle.  Are we
going to enhance my natural beauty, or would you
like it&mdash;er&mdash;toned down a little?  Of course, I <i>could</i>
go as the dog-faced man, only&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Very well then, if you don't like Henry, what
about Edward I.?"
</p>

<p>
"But why do you want to thrust royalty on me?
I'd much sooner go as Perkin Warbeck.  I should
wear a brown perkin&mdash;jerkin."
</p>

<p>
"Jack is going as Sir Walter Raleigh."
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall certainly touch him for a cigarette,"
I said, as I got up to go.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was a week later that I met Elizabeth in Bond
Street.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" she said, "have you got your things?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't," I confessed.
</p>

<p>
"I forget who you said you were going as?"
</p>

<p>
"Somebody who had black hair," I said.  "I
have been thinking it over and I have come to the
conclusion that I should have knocked them rather
if I had had black hair&mdash;instead of curly eyes and
blue hair.  Can you think of anybody for me?"
</p>

<p>
Queen Elizabeth regarded me as sternly as she
might have regarded&mdash;&mdash;  Well, I'm not very good
at history.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say," she said at last, "that that
is as far as you have got?  Somebody who had black
hair?"
</p>

<p>
"Hang it," I protested, "it's something to have
been measured for the wig."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Have</i> you been measured for your wig?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;er&mdash;no&mdash;that is to say, not exactly what
you might call measured.  But&mdash;well, the fact is I
was just going along now, only&mdash;I say, where do I
get a wig?"
</p>

<p>
"You've done nothing," said Elizabeth&mdash;"absolutely
nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I say, don't say that," I began nervously;
"I've done an awful lot, really.  I've practically got
the costume.  I'm going as Harold the Boy Earl,
or Jessica's Last&mdash;&mdash;  Hallo, there's my bus; I've got
a cold, I mustn't keep it waiting.  Good-bye."  And
I fled.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"I am going," I said, "as Julius Cæsar.  He was
practically bald.  Think how cool that will be."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say," cried Elizabeth, "that
you have altered again?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be rough with me or I shall cry.  I've got
an awful cold."
</p>

<p>
"Then you've no business to go as Julius Cæsar."
</p>

<p>
"I say, now you're trying to unsettle me.  And I
was going to-morrow to order the clothes."
</p>

<p>
"What!  You haven't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I was really going this afternoon, only&mdash;only it's
early closing day.  Besides, I wanted to see if my
cold would get better.  Because if it didn't&mdash;&mdash;  Look
here, I'll be frank with you.  I am going as
Charlemagne."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
"Charlemagne in half-mourning, because Pepin
the Short had just died.  Something quiet in grey,
with a stripe, I thought.  Only half-mourning
because he only got half the throne.  By-the-way I
suppose all these people wore pumps and white kid
gloves all right?  Yes, I thought so.  I wonder if
Charlemagne really had black hair.  Anyhow, they
can't prove he didn't, seeing when he lived.  He
flourished about 770, you know.  As a matter of
fact 770 wasn't actually his most flourishing year,
because the Radicals were in power then, and land
went down so.  Now 771&mdash;yes.  Or else as Raymond
Blathwayt."
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow," I added indignantly a minute later,
"I swear I'm going somehow."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Hallo," I said cheerfully, as I ran into her
Majesty in Piccadilly, "I've just been ordering&mdash;that
is to say, I've been going&mdash;&mdash;I mean I'm just going
to&mdash;&mdash;  Let's see, it's next week, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment Elizabeth was speechless&mdash;not at all
my idea of the character.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," she said at last, "I am going to take
you in hand.  Will you trust yourself entirely to me?"
</p>

<p>
"To the death, your Majesty.  I'm sickening for
something, as it is."
</p>

<p>
"How tall are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, more than that," I said quickly.  "Gent's
large medium, I am."
</p>

<p>
"Then, I'll order a costume for you and have it
sent round.  There's no need for you to be anything
historical; you might be a butcher."
</p>

<p>
"Quite&mdash;blue is my colour.  In fact, I can do you
the best end of the neck at tenpence, madam, if
you'll wait a moment while I sharpen the knife.
Let's see; you like it cut on the cross, I think?
Bother, they've forgotten the strop."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it may not be a butcher," said Elizabeth;
"it depends what they've got."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
That was a week ago.  This morning I was really
ill at last; had hardly any breakfast; simply
couldn't look a poached egg in the yolk.  A day on
the sofa in a darkened room and bed at seven o'clock
was my programme.  And then my eye caught a
great box of clothes, and I remembered that the dance
was to-night.  I opened the box.  Perhaps dressed
soberly as a black-haired butcher I could look in for
an hour or two ... and&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Help!</i>
</p>

<p>
A yellow waistcoat, pink breeches, and&mdash;no, it's
not an eider-down, it's a coat.
</p>

<p>
<i>A yellow&mdash;&mdash;  Pink br&mdash;&mdash;</i>
</p>

<p>
I am going as Joseph.
</p>

<p>
I am going as Swan &amp; Edgar.
</p>

<p>
I am going as the Sick Duke, by Orchardson.
</p>

<p>
I am going&mdash;yes, that's it, I am going back to bed.

<h3>
AFTER DINNER
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
I. THE COMPLETE KITCHEN
</p>

<p>
I wat in the drawing-room after dinner with my
knees together and my hands in my lap, and
waited for the game to be explained to me.
</p>

<p>
"There's a pencil for you," said somebody.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much," I said, and put it carefully
away.  Evidently I had won a forfeit already.
It wasn't a very good pencil though.
</p>

<p>
"Now, has everybody got pencils?" asked somebody
else.  "The game is called 'Furnishing a
Kitchen.'  It's quite easy.  Will somebody think
of a letter?"  She turned to me.  "Perhaps you'd
better."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," I said, and I immediately thought
very hard of N.  These thought-reading games are
called different things, but they are all the same
really, and I don't believe in any of them.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said everybody.
</p>

<p>
"What? ... Yes, I have.  Go on....  Oh, I beg
your pardon," I said in confusion.  I thought
you&mdash;&mdash;  N. is the letter."
</p>

<p>
"N or M?"
</p>

<p>
I smiled knowingly to myself.
</p>

<p>
"My godfather and my godmother," I went on
cautiously&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It was N," interrupted somebody.  "Now then,
you've got five minutes in which to write down
everything you can beginning with N.  Go."  And
they all started to write like anything.
</p>

<p>
I took my pencil out and began to think.  I know
it sounds an easy game to you now, as you sit at your
desk surrounded by dictionaries; but when you are
squeezed on to the edge of a sofa, given a very blunt
pencil and a thin piece of paper, and challenged to
write in five minutes (on your knees) all the words
you can think of beginning with a certain letter&mdash;well,
it is another matter altogether.  I thought of
no end of things which started with K, or even L;
I thought of "rhinoceros," which is a very long word
and starts with R; but as for&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
I looked at my watch and groaned.  One minute gone.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>must</i> keep calm," I said, and in a bold hand I
wrote <i>Napoleon</i>.  Then, after a moment's thought, I
added <i>Nitro-glycerine</i>, and <i>Nats</i>.
</p>

<p>
"This is splendid," I told myself.  "<i>Notting Hill</i>,
<i>Nobody</i> and <i>Noon</i>.  That makes six."
</p>

<p>
At six I stuck for two minutes.  I did worse than
that in fact; for I suddenly remembered that gnats
were spelt with a G.  However, I decided to leave
them, in case nobody else remembered.  And on the
fourth minute I added <i>Non-sequitur</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Time!" said somebody.
</p>

<p>
"Just a moment," said everybody.  They wrote
down another word or two (which isn't fair) and then
began to add up.  "I've got thirty," said one.
</p>

<p>
"Thirty-two."
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-five."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens," I said, "I've only got seven."
</p>

<p>
There was a shout of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Then you'd better begin," said somebody.
"Read them out."
</p>

<p>
I coughed doubtfully, and began;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Napoleon.</i>"
</p>

<p>
There was another shout of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid we can't allow that."
</p>

<p>
"Why ever not?" I asked in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'd hardly find him in a kitchen, would you?"
</p>

<p>
I took out a handkerchief and wiped my brow.  "I
don't want to find him in a kitchen," I said nervously.
"Why should I?  As a matter of fact, he's dead.  I
don't see what the kitchen's got to do with it.
Kitchens begin with a K."
</p>

<p>
"But the game is called 'Furnishing a Kitchen.'  You
have to make a list of things beginning with N
which you would find in a kitchen.  You understood
that, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Y-y-yes," I said.  "Oh y-y-y-yes.  Of course."
</p>

<p>
"So Napoleon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I pulled myself together with a great effort.
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand," I said with dignity.
"The cook's name was Napoleon."
</p>

<p>
"Cooks aren't called Napoleon," said everybody.
</p>

<p>
"This one was.  Carrie Napoleon.  Her mistress
was just as surprised at first as you were, but Carrie
assured her that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm afraid we can't allow it."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," I said; "I'm wrong about that.  Her
name was Carrie Smith.  But her young man was a
soldier, and she had bought a 'Life of Napoleon' for
a birthday present for him.  It stood on the dresser&mdash;it
did, really&mdash;waiting for her next Sunday out."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Oh, well, I suppose that is possible.  Go on."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Gnats</i>," I went on nervously and hastily.  "Of
course I know that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Gnats are spelt with a G," they shrieked.
</p>

<p>
"These weren't.  They had lost the G when they
were quite young, and consequently couldn't bite at
all, and cook said that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm afraid not."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," I said resignedly.  "I had about
forty of them&mdash;on the dresser.  If you won't allow
any of them, it pulls me down a lot.  Er&mdash;then we
have Nitro-glycerine."
</p>

<p>
There was another howl of derision.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," I said haughtily.  "Cook had chapped
hands very badly, and she went to the chemist's one
evening for a little glycerine.  The chemist was out,
and his assistant&mdash;a very nervous young fellow&mdash;gave
her nitro-glycerine by mistake.  It stood on the
dresser, it did, really."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said everybody very reluctantly, "I
suppose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I went on hastily:
</p>

<p>
"That's two.  Then <i>Nobody</i>.  Of course, you
might easily find nobody in the kitchen.  In fact
you would pretty often, I should say.  Three.  The
next is <i>Noon</i>.  It could be noon in the kitchen as
well as anywhere else.  Don't be narrow-minded
about that."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Go on."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Non-sequitur</i>," I said doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's a little difficult to explain, but the idea is
this.  At most restaurants you can get a second help
of anything for half-price, and that is technically
called a 'follow.'  Now, if they didn't give you a
follow, that would be a <i>Non-sequitur</i>....  You do
see that, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
There was a deadly silence.
</p>

<p>
"Five," I said cheerfully.  "The last is <i>Notting
Hill</i>.  I must confess," I said magnanimously, "that
I am a bit doubtful whether you would actually find
Notting Hill in a kitchen."
</p>

<p>
"You <i>don't</i> say so!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  My feeling is that you would be more
likely to find the kitchen in Notting Hill.  On the
other hand, it is just possible that, as Calais was found
engraven on Mary's heart, so, supposing the cook
died&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, very well.  Then it remains at five."
</p>

<p>
Of course you think that, as I only had five, I
came out last.  But you are wrong.  There is a
pleasing rule in this game that, if you have any word
in your list which somebody else has, you cannot
count it.  And as all the others had the obvious
things&mdash;such as a nutmeg-grater or a neck of mutton
or a nomelette&mdash;my five won easily.  And you will
note that, if only I had been allowed to count my
gnats, it would have been forty-five.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II. GETTING THE NEEDLE
</p>

<p>
He was a pale, enthusiastic young man of the name
of Simms; and he held forth to us at great length
about his latest hobby.
</p>

<p>
"Now I'll just show you a little experiment," he
wound up; "one that I have never known to fail.
First of all, I want you to hide a needle somewhere,
while I am out of the room.  You must stick it
where it can be seen&mdash;on a chair&mdash;or on the floor if
you like.  Then I shall come back and find it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr Simms!" we all said.
</p>

<p>
"Now, which one of you has the strongest will?"
</p>

<p>
We pushed Jack forward.  Jack is at any rate a
big man.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  I shall want you to take my hand
when I come in, and look steadily at the needle,
concentrate all your thoughts on it.  I, on the other
hand, shall make my mind a perfect blank.  Then
your thoughts will gradually pass into my brain, and
I shall feel myself as it were dragged in the direction
of the needle."
</p>

<p>
"And I shall feel myself, as it were, dragged after
you?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; you mustn't put any strain on my arm at
all.  Let me go just where I like, only will me to go
in the right direction.  Now then."
</p>

<p>
He took out his handkerchief, put it hastily back,
and said: "First, I shall want to borrow a
handkerchief or something."
</p>

<p>
Well, we blindfolded him, and led him out of the
room.  Then Muriel got a needle, which, after some
discussion, was stuck into the back of the Chesterfield.
Simms returned, and took Jack's left hand.
</p>

<p>
They stood there together, Jack frowning earnestly
at the needle, and Simms swaying uncertainly at the
knees.  Suddenly his knees went in altogether, and
he made a little zig-zag dash across the room, as
though he were taking cover.  Jack lumbered after
him, instinctively bending his head too.  They were
brought up by the piano, which Simms struck with
great force.  We all laughed, and Jack apologised.
</p>

<p>
"You told me to let you go where you liked, you
know," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," said Simms rather peevishly, "but
you should have willed me not to hit the piano."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he tripped over a small stool, and,
flinging out an arm to save himself, swept two
photograph frames off an occasional table.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" said Jack, "that's jolly good.  I
saw you were going to do that, and I willed that the
flower vase should be spared.  I'm getting on."
</p>

<p>
"I think you had better start from the door
again," I suggested.  "Then you can get a clear
run."
</p>

<p>
They took up their original positions.
</p>

<p>
"You must think hard, please," said Simms again.
"My mind is a perfect blank, and yet I can feel
nothing coming."
</p>

<p>
Jack made terrible faces at the needle.  Then,
without warning, Simms flopped on to the floor at
full length, pulling Jack after him.
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't mind if I do that," he said, getting
up slowly.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Jack, dusting himself.
</p>

<p>
"I felt irresistibly compelled to go down," said
Simms.
</p>

<p>
"So did I," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"The needle is very often hidden in the floor, you
see.  You are sure you are looking at it?"
</p>

<p>
They were in a corner with their backs to it; and
Jack, after trying in vain to get it over his right
shoulder or his left, bent down and focussed it
between his legs.  This must have connected the
current; for Simms turned right round and marched
up to the needle.
</p>

<p>
"There!" he said triumphantly, taking off the
bandage.
</p>

<p>
We all clapped, while Jack poured himself out a
whisky.  Simms turned to him.
</p>

<p>
"You have a very strong will indeed," he said,
"one of the strongest I have met.  Now, would one
of the ladies like to try?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm sure I couldn't," said all the ladies.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to do it again," said Simms modestly.
"Perhaps you, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"All right, I'll try," I said.
</p>

<p>
When Simms was outside I told them my idea.
</p>

<p>
"I'll hold the needle in my other hand," I said,
"and then I can always look at it easily, and it will
always be in a different place, which ought to muddle
him."
</p>

<p>
We fetched him in, and he took my left hand....
</p>

<p>
"No, it's no good," he said at last, "I don't seem
to get it.  Let me try the other hand...."
</p>

<p>
I had no time to warn him.  He clasped the other
hand firmly; and, from the shriek that followed, it
seemed that he got it.  There ensued the "perfect
blank" that he had insisted on all the evening.
Then he pulled off the bandage, and showed a very
angry face.
</p>

<p>
Well, we explained how accidental it was, and
begged him to try again.  He refused rather
sulkily.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Jack said: "I believe I could do it
blindfold.  Miss Muriel, will you look at the needle
and see if you can will me?"
</p>

<p>
Simms bucked up a bit, and seemed keen on the
idea.  So Jack was blindfolded, the needle hid, and
Muriel took his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Now, is your mind a perfect blank?" said Simms
to Jack.
</p>

<p>
"It always is," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then.  You ought soon to feel in a
dreamy state, as though you were in another world.
Miss Muriel, <i>you</i> must think only of the needle."
</p>

<p>
Jack held her hand tight, and looked most idiotically
peaceful.  After three minutes Simms spoke
again.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he said eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I've got the dreamy, other-world state perfectly,"
said Jack, and then he gave at the knees just for the
look of the thing.
</p>

<p>
"This is silly," said Muriel, trying to get her hand
away.
</p>

<p>
Jack staggered violently, and gripped her hand
again.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Please</i>, Miss Muriel," implored Simms.  "I feel
sure he is just going to do it."
</p>

<p>
Jack staggered again, sawed the air with his
disengaged hand, and then turned right round and
marched for the door, dragging Muriel behind him.
The door slammed after them....
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
There is a little trick of sitting on a chair and
picking a pin out of it with the teeth.  I started
Simms&mdash;who was all eagerness to follow the pair,
and find out the mysterious force that was drawing
them&mdash;upon this trick, for Jack is one of my best
friends.  When Jack and Muriel came back from the
billiard-room, and announced that they were engaged,
Simms was on his back on the floor with the chair on
the top of him&mdash;explaining, for the fourth time, that
if the thing had not overbalanced at the critical
moment he would have secured the object.  There
is much to be said for this view.

<h3>
BACHELOR DAYS
</h3>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
THE BUTTER
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't think I am afraid of my housekeeper.
Not at all.  I frequently meet her on
the stairs, and give her some such order as "I
think&mdash;if you don't mind&mdash;I might have breakfast just a
<i>little</i> later&mdash;er, yes, about eight o'clock, yes, thank
you."  Or I ring the bell and say, "I&mdash;I&mdash;want-my-boots."  We
both recognise that it is mine to
command and hers to obey.  But in the matter of
the butter I have let things slide, until the position
is rapidly becoming an untenable one.  Yet I doubt
if a man of imagination and feeling could have acted
otherwise, given the initial error.  However, you
shall hear.
</p>

<p>
There are two sorts of butter, salt and fresh.
Now, nobody is so fond of butter as I am; but
butter (as I have often told everybody) isn't butter
at all unless it is salt.  The other kind is merely an
inferior vaseline&mdash;the sort of thing you put on the
axles of locomotives.  Imagine, then, my disgust,
when I took my first breakfast in these rooms eleven
months ago, to find that the housekeeper had
provided me with a large lump of vaseline!
</p>

<p>
I hate waste in small things.  Take care of the
little extravagances, I say, and the big ones will take
care of themselves.  My first thought on viewing
this pat of butter was, "It is difficult, but I will eat
it."  My second, "But I must tell the housekeeper to
get salt butter next time."
</p>

<p>
An ordinary-minded person would have stopped
there.  I went one further.  My third thought was
this: "Housekeepers are forgetful creatures.  If I
tell her now, she will never remember.  Obviously
I had better wait until this pound is just finished
and she is about to get in some more.  Then will be
the time to speak."  So I waited; and it was here
that I made my mistake.  For it turned out that it
was I who was the forgetful creature.  And on the
fifteenth day I got up to find another large pound of
vaseline on my table.  The next fortnight went by
slowly.  I kept my eye on every day, waiting for the
moment to come when I could say to the housekeeper,
"You will be getting me in some more butter this
morning.  Would you get salt, as I don't much like
the other?"  Wednesday came, and there was just
enough left for two days.  I would speak on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
But, alas! on the morrow there was another new
pound waiting.  I had evidently misjudged the amount.
</p>

<p>
I forget what happened after that.  I fancy I
must have been very busy, so that the question of
butter escaped me altogether.  Sometimes, too, I
would go away for a few days and the old butter
would be thrown away and the new butter bought,
at a time when I had no opportunity of defending
myself.  However it was, there came a time when I
had been three months in my rooms, and was still
eating fresh butter; contentedly, to all appearances&mdash;in
the greatest anguish of soul, as it happened.  And
at the end of another month I said: "Now, then, I
really must do something about this."
</p>

<p>
But what <i>could</i> I do?  After eating fresh butter
for four months without protest I couldn't possibly
tell the housekeeper that I didn't like it, and would
she get salt in future.  That would be too absurd.
Fancy taking four months to discover a little thing
like that!  Nor could I pretend that, though I used
to adore fresh butter, I had now grown tired of it.
I hate instability of character, and I could not lend
myself to any such fickleness.  I put it to you that
either of these courses would have shown deplorable
weakness.  No, an explanation with the housekeeper
was by that time impossible; and if anything was
to be done I must do it on my own responsibility.
What about buying a pound of salt butter myself,
and feeding on it in secret?  True, I should have to
get rid of a certain portion of fresh every day,
but...
</p>

<p>
I don't know if you have ever tried to get rid of a
certain portion of fresh butter every day, when you
are living in a flat at the very top of chambers in
London.  Drop it out of the window once or twice,
and it is an accident.  Three times, and it is a
coincidence.  Four times, and the policeman on duty
begins to think that there is more in it (if I may say
so) than meets the eye....  But what about the
fire, you will ask.  Ah, yes; but I could foresee a
day when there would be no fire.  One has to look
ahead.
</p>

<p>
Besides, as I said, I hate waste.  As any cook will
tell you, the whole art of housekeeping can be summed
up in three words&mdash;<i>Watch the butter</i>.
</p>

<p>
More months passed and more pats of vaseline.
Every day made an explanation more hopeless.  I
had thoughts at one time of an anonymous letter.
Something in this style:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"MADAM,&mdash;One who is your friend says beware
of vaseline.  All is discovered.  Fly before it is too
late.  What is it makes the sea so salt?  NaCl.
Sodium Chloride.  THE BLACK HAND"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That would give her the impression, at any rate,
that there <i>were</i> two kinds of butter.  Confound it
all, by what right did she assume without asking that
I had a preference for fresh?
</p>

<p>
I have now been in my rooms nearly a year.  Something
must be done soon.  My breakfasts are becoming
a farce.  Meals which I used to enjoy I now face
as an ordeal.  Is there to be no hope for me in the
future?
</p>

<p>
Well, there <i>is</i> a chance?  I shall have to wait
until July; but with something definite in view I am
content to wait.
</p>

<p>
In July I hope to go to Switzerland for a month.
Two days before returning home I shall write to my
housekeeper.  Having announced the day of my
return, and given one or two instructions, I shall refer
briefly to the pleasant holiday which I have been
enjoying.  I shall remark perhaps on the grandeur of
the mountains and the smiling beauty of the valleys,
I may mention the area in square miles of the
country....
</p>

<p>
And I shall dwell upon the habits of the native.
</p>

<p>
"... They live (I shall write) in extraordinary
simplicity, chiefly upon the products of their farms.
Their butter is the most delightful I have ever tried.
It is a little salt to the taste, but after four weeks of
it I begin to feel that I shall never be able to do
without salt butter again!  No doubt, as made in London
it would be different from this, but I really think I
must give it a trial.  So when you are ordering the
things I mentioned for me, will you ask for salt
butter...."
</p>

<p>
And if that fails there remains only the one consolation.
In three years my lease is up.  I shall take a
new flat somewhere, and on the very first day I shall
have a word with the new housekeeper.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," I shall say, "about the butter...."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0602"></a></p>

<h3>
THE WASHING
</h3>

<p>
Of course, it is quite possible to marry for love,
but I suspect that a good many bachelors
marry so that they may not have to bother about
the washing any more.  That, anyhow, will be one
of the reasons with me.  "I offer you," I shall say,
"my hand and heart&mdash;and the washing; and, oh,
<i>do</i> see that six tablecloths and my footer shorts
don't get sent <i>every</i> week."
</p>

<p>
We affect Hampstead for some reason.  Every
week a number of shirts and things goes all the way
out to Hampstead and back.  I once sent a Panama
to Paris to be cleaned, and for quite a year afterwards
I used to lead the conversation round to travel, and
then come out with, "Ah, I well remember when my
Panama was in Paris...."  So now, when I am
asked at a dance, "Do you know Hampstead at all?"  I
reply, "Well, I only know it slightly myself; but
my collars spend about half the year there.  They
are in with all the best people."
</p>

<p>
I can believe that I am not popular in Hampstead,
for I give my laundress a lot of trouble.  Take a
little thing like handkerchiefs.  My rooms, as I have
mentioned, are at the very top of the building, and
there is no lift.  Usually I wait till I am just out into
the street before I discover that I have forgotten my
handkerchief.  It is quite impossible to climb all the
stairs again, so I go and buy one for the day.  This
happens about three times a week.  The result is
that nearly all my handkerchiefs are single ones&mdash;there
are no litters of twelve, no twins even, or
triplets.  Now when you have a lot of strangers in a
drawer like this, with no family ties (or anything)
to keep them together, what wonder if they gradually
drift away from each other?
</p>

<p>
My laundress does her best for them.  She works
a sort of birthmark in red cotton in the corner of
each, so that she shall know them again.  When I
saw it first I was frightened.  It looked like the
password of some secret society.
</p>

<p>
"Are there many aliens in Hampstead?" I asked
the housekeeper.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, look here, what I found on my handkerchief.
That's a secret signal of some sort, you know, that's
what it is.  I shall get mixed up in some kind of
anarchist row before I know where I am.  Will you
arrange about getting my clothes washed somewhere
else, please?"
</p>

<p>
"That's because you haven't got your name on it.
She must mark them somehow."
</p>

<p>
"Then, why doesn't she mark them with my name?
So much simpler."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't her business to mark your clothes," said
the housekeeper.
</p>

<p>
That, I suppose, is true; but it seems to me that
she is giving us both a lot of unnecessary trouble.
Every week I pick out this decorative design with a
penknife, and every week she works it in again.
When you consider the time and the red cotton wasted
it becomes clear that a sixpenny bottle of marking ink
and a quill pen would be cheaper to her in the long
run.
</p>

<p>
But she has a weakness for red cotton.  The holes
in the handkerchiefs she works round with it&mdash;I never
quite understand why.  To call my attention to them,
perhaps, and to prevent me from falling through.
Or else to say, "<i>You</i> did this.  I only washed up to
the red, so it can't be <i>my</i> fault."
</p>

<p>
If I were married and had a house of my own, there
would be no man below; consequently he wouldn't
wear the absurd collars he does.  I get about two
of them a week (so even red cotton is not infallible);
and if they were the right size and a decent shape I
shouldn't grumble so much.  But I do object to my
collars mixing in town with these extraordinary
things of his.  At Hampstead, it may be, they have
to meet on terms of equality, more or less; force of
circumstances throws them together a good deal.
But in town no collar of mine could be expected to
keep up the acquaintance.  "You knew me in the
bath," I can imagine one of his monstrosities saying;
and, "When I am in the bath I shall know you
again," would be the dignified reply of my "16-Golf."
</p>

<p>
Collars trouble me a good deal one way or another.
Whenever I buy a new dozen, all the others seem
suddenly to have become old-fashioned in shape, and
of the wrong size.  Nothing will induce me to wear
one of them again.  They get put away in boxes.
Covered with dust, they lie forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Forgotten, did I say?  No.  The housekeeper
finds them and sends them to the wash.  About a
month later she finds them again.  She is always
finding clothes which have been discarded for ever,
and sending them to the wash.
</p>

<p>
The mistake is, that we have not yet come to an
agreement as to what really <i>is</i> to go to the wash, and
what isn't.  There is a tacit understanding that
everything on the floor on Monday morning is intended
for Hampstead.  The floor is the linen-basket.  It
seemed a good idea at the time, but it has its faults.
Things gets on to the floor somehow, which were
never meant for the north-west&mdash;blankets, and
parts of a tweed suit, and sofa cushions.  Things
have a mysterious way of dropping.  Half-a-dozen
pairs of white flannel trousers dropped from a shelf
one December.  A pair of footer shorts used to go
every week&mdash;a pair which I would carefully put
down to take the bath water when I had finished
with it.  I wonder what those shorts thought they
were doing.  Probably they quite fancied themselves
at football, and boasted about the goals they
shot to companions whom they met at Hampstead.
</p>

<p>
"You're <i>always</i> here!" a pair of local wanderers
would say.
</p>

<p>
"My dear man, I play so hard, I don't care how
dirty I get."
</p>

<p>
The irony of it!
</p>

<p>
But, worst of all, the laundry-book.  Every week
the housekeeper says to me, "Would you pay your
book now, as it's been owing for a month?"  And
every week I pay.  That sounds absurd, but I swear
it's true.  Or else the weeks go very quickly.
</p>

<p>
And such amounts!  Great ninepences for a
counterpane or a tablecloth or a white tie.  Immense
numbers of handkerchiefs, counting (apparently)
twelve as thirteen.  Quaint hieroglyphics, which
don't mean anything but seem to get added into the
price.  And always that little postscript, "As this
has been owing for a month, we must request...."
</p>

<h3>
TAKING STOCK
</h3>

<p>
Beatrice has been spring-cleaning me to-day,
or rather my clothes.  I said, wasn't it rather
early for it, as none of the birds were singing properly
yet, and she had much better wait till next year; but
no, she <i>would</i> do it <i>now</i>.  Beatrice is my sister-in-law,
and she said&mdash;&mdash;  Well, I forget what she did say,
but she took a whole bundle of things away with her
in a cab; and I <i>know</i> John will be wearing that
purple shirt of mine to-morrow.  As a matter of fact,
it was a perfectly new one, and I was only waiting
till Lent was over.
</p>

<p>
Beatrice said the things were all lying about
anyhow, and how I ever found anything to put on she
didn't know; but I could have told her that they were
all arranged on a symmetrical plan of my own.
Beatrice doesn't understand the symmetry of a
bachelor's mind.  I like a collar in each drawer, and
then, whatever drawer you open, there's a collar
ready for you.  Beatrice puts them all in one drawer,
and then if you're in a hurry, and open the wrong
drawer by mistake, you probably go up to the office
in two waistcoats and no collar at all.  That would
be very awkward.
</p>

<p>
Beatrice actually wanted a braces drawer (if she
hadn't married John I should never let her talk to
me about braces), but I explained that I had only
one pair, and was wearing those, so that it would be
absurd.  I expect she wanted me to think that John
had two pairs.  All I can say, is, that, if he has, he
ought to be above taking my best shirt....
</p>

<p>
I don't think the waistcoat drawer will be a success.
There are twenty-three of them, and some of them
don't blend at all well.  Twenty-three in one
drawer&mdash;you know there are bound to be disputes.  I see
<i>William</i> has got to the top already.  Ah! he was a
fine fellow, the first I ever had.  I don't quite know
how to describe him, but in colour he was emerald
green, with bits of red silk peeping through.  Sort
of open-work, you know, only where you would
expect to see me there was more of <i>William</i>.  I wore
him at Beatrice's wedding.  He <i>would</i> come.  Only
he wouldn't let me into the vestry.  I wanted to sign
my name; all the others were.  I have never worn
him since that day, but Beatrice has fished him out,
and now he lies on the very top of the drawer.
</p>

<p>
Of course it's awfully good of Beatrice to take so
much trouble about my clothes, and I'm extremely
grateful, and after all she did marry my brother John;
but I think sometimes she&mdash;&mdash;  Well, here's a case.
You know, when you have twenty-three waistcoats
you perhaps run a bit short of&mdash;of other things.  So,
naturally, the few you <i>have</i> got left, you&mdash;&mdash;  Well,
Beatrice took them all away, and said that as I
couldn't possibly wear them again she'd cut them up
for house-cloths.  And really&mdash;half-way between
winter and summer is a very awkward time for
restocking.  But I suppose it is going to be warmer
now?
</p>

<p>
<i>House-cloths</i>!  I bet John has a go at them
first.
</p>

<p>
Beatrice found what they call in the profession a
"morning-coat and vest" under the bed, and said
that she would take it away and sell it for me.  I like
the way she "finds" things which I have been keeping
for years under the bed.  It is absurd to talk
about "finding" anything in a small flat, because, of
course, it's there all the time: but Beatrice thought
that I ought to be grateful to her for the discovery,
so I pretended I was.  She said she would get at
least half-a-crown for it; but I said I would rather
have the coat.  However, it turned out that I wasn't
even to have had the half-crown....
</p>

<p>
I used to have thirty pairs of old white gloves in
a drawer.  I would take them out sometimes, and
stroke them affectionately, and say, "Ah, yes, those
were the ones I wore at that absolutely ripping dance
when I first met Cynthia, and we had supper together.
You can see where I spilt the ice pudding."  Or&mdash;"This
was that Hunt Ball, when I knew nobody
and danced with Hildegarde all the time.  She wore
black; just look at them now."  Well, Beatrice had
<i>that</i> drawer out pretty quick.  And now they are on
their way to Perth or Paris, or wherever it is; except
Hildegarde's pair, which will just do for the girl when
she cleans the grates.  I expect she really will get
them you know; because John doesn't dance.
</p>

<p>
You know, you mustn't make too much fun of
Beatrice; she has ripping ideas sometimes.  She
filled a "summer-trunk" for me&mdash;a trunk full of all
the clothes I am going to want in the summer.  She
started with a tennis-racquet (which, strictly speaking,
isn't clothes at all), and went on with some of the
jolliest light waistcoats you ever saw; it made me
quite hot to look at them.  Well, now, that's really
a good idea so far as it goes.  But what will happen
when the summer does come?  Why, we shall have
to go through the whole business all over again.
And who'll arrange the winter-trunk?  Beatrice.
And who'll get the pink pyjamas and the green
socks that there's really no room for, dear?  Why,
John.
</p>

<p>
Yet I am sorry for John.  He was once as I am.
What a life is his now.  Beatrice is a dear, and I
will allow no one to say a word against her, but she
doesn't understand that trousers must be folded, not
hung; that a collar which has once been a collar can
never be opened out and turned into a cuff (supposing
one wore cuffs); and that a school eleven blazer,
even if it happens to be pink, must not be cut down
into a dressing-jacket for the little one.  Poor John!
Yes, I am glad now that he has that shirt of mine.
It is perhaps a <i>little</i> too bright for his complexion,
perhaps he has not <i>quite</i> the air to carry it off; but
I am glad that it is his.  Now I think of it I have a
tie and a pair of socks that would go well with it;
and even <i>William</i>&mdash;can I part with <i>William</i>?&mdash;yes,
he shall have <i>William</i>.  Oh, I see that I must be
kind to John.
</p>

<p>
Dear Beatrice!  I wonder when I shall have
everything straight again.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0604"></a></p>

<h3>
MEDES AND PERSIANS
</h3>

<p>
I have already said that I am not afraid of my
housekeeper, so there is no need for me to say
it again.  There are other motives than fear which
prevent a man from arguing with housekeepers;
dislike of conversation with his intellectual inferiors
may be one, the sporting instinct is certainly another.
If one is to play "Medes and Persians" properly,
one must be a sportsman about it.  Of course, I
could say right out to her "Do this," and she might
do it.  Or she could say right out to me, "Do that,"
and I would reply, "Don't be absurd."  But that
wouldn't be the game.
</p>

<p>
As I play it, a "Mede" is a law which <i>she</i> lays
down, and to which (after many a struggle) in the
end I submit; a "Persian" is a law which <i>I</i> lay
down, and to which ... after many a struggle
... in the end ... (when it is too late)....  Well,
there are many Medes, but so far I have only scored
one Persian of note.
</p>

<p>
The first Mede was established last winter.  For
many weeks I had opened my bedroom door of a
morning to find a small jug of cold water on the mat
outside.  The thing puzzled me.  What do I want
with a small jug of cold water, I asked myself, when
I have quite enough in the bath as it is?  Various
happy thoughts occurred to me&mdash;as that it was lucky,
that it collected the germs, or (who knows?)
indicated a wife with five thousand a year&mdash;but it was
a month before the real solution flashed across my
mind.  "Perhaps," I said, "it was hot once.  But,"
I added, "it must have been a long time ago."
</p>

<p>
The discovery upset me a good deal.  In the first
place, it is annoying suddenly to have all one's hopes
of a rich wife and protection from disease dashed to
the ground; in the second, I object to anybody but
a relation interfering with my moral character.
Here was a comparative stranger trying to instil the
habit of early rising into me by leaving shaving-water
outside the door at three A.M.  Was this a
thing to be taken lying down?
</p>

<p>
Decidedly.  So I stayed in bed and ignored the
water-jug; save that each morning, as I left my
rooms, I gave it a parting sneer.  It was gone by the
evening, but turned up again all right next day.
After a month I began to get angry.  My housekeeper
was defying me; very well, we would see who
could last the longer.
</p>

<p>
But after two months it was a Mede.  Yet I have
this triumph over her.  That though I take the
water in I ... pour it into the bath and slip back
into bed again.  I don't think she knows that.
</p>

<p>
Since then there have been many Medes.  Little
ones as to the position of the chairs; bigger ones as
to the number of blankets on the bed.  You mustn't
think, though, that I always submit so easily.
Sometimes I am firm.  In the matter of "Africa Joe" I
have been very firm.  Here, I know, I have right on
my side.
</p>

<p>
A year ago I was presented with a model of an
Irish jolting car (with horse and driver complete),
which had been cut out of some sort of black wood.
The thing used to stand over my fireplace.  Later on
I acquired, at different times, a grey hippopotamus
(in china) and a black elephant.  These I harnessed
on in front of the horse; and the whole affair made
a very pretty scene, which was known to my friends
as "Sunday in the Forest: Africa Joe drives his
Family to Church."  Besides all these I had yet
another animal&mdash;a green frog climbing a cardboard
ladder.  I leant this against the clock.  One had the
illusion that the frog was climbing up in order to
look at the works&mdash;which was particularly pleasing
because the clock didn't go.
</p>

<p>
Very well.  You have the two scenes on the
same mantelboard.  One, the frog as Bond Street
watchmaker and jeweller, and the other (such is
Empire), Africa Joe in the heart of the forest.  And
what does the housekeeper do?  If you will believe
me, she takes the frog down from the clock and
props him up behind the car, just as though he were
getting on to it in order to go to church with the
others!
</p>

<p>
Now I do put it to you that this is simply spoiling
the picture altogether.  Here we have a pleasant
domestic episode, such as must occur frequently in
the African forests.  Black Joe harnesses his horse,
elephant, hippopotamus, or what not, and drives his
family to the eleven o'clock service.  And into this
scene of rural simplicity a mere housekeeper elbows
her way with irrevelant frogs and ladders!
</p>

<p>
It is a mystery to me that she cannot see how
absurd her contribution is.  To begin with, the
family is in black (save the hippopotamus, who is in
a quiet grey), so is it likely that they would tolerate
the presence of a garish green-and-yellow stranger?
(More than likely Joe is a churchwarden, and has not
only himself to think of.)  Then, again, consider
the title of the scene: "Africa Joe <i>drives</i> his
Family"&mdash;not "Africa Joe about to drive."  The horse is
trotting, the elephant has one leg uplifted, and even
the hippopotamus is not in a position of rest.  How
then could the frog put a ladder up against a moving
cart, and climb in?  No; here anyhow was a Mede
that must be resisted at all costs.  On the question
of Africa Joe I would not be dictated to.
</p>

<p>
But, after re-emphasising my position daily for
three weeks, I saw that there was only one thing to
do.  The frog must be sacrificed to the idea of
Empire.  So I burnt him.
</p>

<p>
But it is time I mentioned my one Persian.  It
was this way.  In the winter I used always to dry
myself after the bath in front of my sitting-room
fire.  Now, I know all about refraction, and the
difficulty of seeing into a room from outside, and so
forth, but this particular room is unusually light,
having six large windows along one of its sides.  I
thought it proper, therefore, to draw down the three
end blinds by the fireplace; more especially as the
building directly opposite belonged to the Public
House Reform Association.  In the fierce light that
beats from reform associations one cannot be too
careful.
</p>

<p>
Little things like blinds easily escape the memory,
and it was obvious that it would be much pleasanter
if the housekeeper could be trained always to leave
the end three down.  The training followed its usual
course.
</p>

<p>
Every morning I found the blinds up and every
morning I drew them down and left them there.
After a month it seemed impossible that I could ever
establish my Persian.  But then she forgot somehow;
and one day I woke up to find the three blinds
down.
</p>

<p>
By a real stroke of genius I drew them up as soon
as my dressing was over.  Next morning they were
down again.  I bathed, dried, dressed and threw
them up.  She thought it was a Mede, and pulled
them down.
</p>

<p>
But it was a Persian, and, as I pulled them up, I
knew that I had scored.
</p>

<p>
Yet, after all, I am not so sure.  For it is now the
summer, and I have no fire, and I do not want the
blinds left down.  And when I pull them up every
morning I really want to find them up next morning.
But I find them down.  So perhaps it really is a
Mede.  To tell the truth, the distinction between
the two is not so clear as it ought to be.  I must try
to come to some arrangement with the housekeeper
about it.
</p>

<h3>
THE CUPBOARD
</h3>

<p>
It was the landlord who first called my attention
to the cupboard; I should never have noticed it
myself.
</p>

<p>
"A very useful cupboard you see there," he said,
"I should include that in the fixtures."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said I, not at all surprised; for the
idea of his taking away the cupboard had not
occurred to me.
</p>

<p>
"You won't find many rooms in London with a
cupboard like that."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose not," I said.  "Well, I'll let you have
my decision in a few days.  The rent with the
cupboard, you say, is&mdash;&mdash;"  And I named the price.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, with the cupboard."
</p>

<p>
So that settled the cupboard question.
</p>

<p>
Settled it so far as it concerned him.  For me it
was only the beginning.  In the year that followed
my eyes were opened, so that I learned at last to put
the right value on a cupboard.  I appreciate now
the power of the mind which conceived this thing,
the nobility of the great heart which included it
among the fixtures.  And I am not ungrateful.
</p>

<p>
You may tell a newly married man by the way he
talks of his garden.  The pretence is that he grows
things there&mdash;verbenas and hymantifilums and
cinerarias, anything which sounds; but of course one
knows that what he really uses it for is to bury in it
things which he doesn't want.  Some day I shall
have a garden of my own in which to conduct
funerals with the best of them; until that day I
content myself with my cupboard.
</p>

<p>
It is marvellous how things lie about and accumulate.
Until they are safely in the cupboard we are
never quite at ease; they have so much to say
outside, and they put themselves just where you want
to step, and sometimes they fall on you.  Yet even
when I have them in the cupboard I am not without
moments of regret.  For later on I have to open it to
introduce companions, and then the sight of some
old friend saddens me with the thought of what
might have been.  "Oh, and I did mean to hang
you up over the writing-desk," I say remorsefully.
</p>

<p>
I am thinking now of a certain picture&mdash;a large
portrait of my old headmaster.  It lay in a corner
for months, waiting to be framed, getting more dingy
and dirty every day.  For the first few weeks I said
to myself, "I must clean that before I send it to the
shop.  A piece of bread will do it."  Later, "It's
extraordinary how clever these picture people are.
You'd think it was hopeless now, but I've no doubt,
when I take it round to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A month after that somebody trod on it....
</p>

<p>
Now, then, I ask you&mdash;what could I do with it
but put it in the cupboard?  You cannot give a
large photograph of a headmaster, bent across the
waistcoat, to a housekeeper, and tell her that you
have finished with it.  Nor would a dustman make
it his business to collect pedagogues along with the
usual cabbage stalks.  A married man would have
buried it under the begonia; but having no garden....
</p>

<p>
That is my difficulty.  For a bachelor in chambers
who cannot bury, there should be some other
consuming element than fire.  In the winter I might
possibly have burnt it is small quantities&mdash;Monday
the head, Tuesday the watch-chain&mdash;but in the
summer what does one do with it?  And what does
one do with the thousands of other things which
have had their day&mdash;the old magazines, letters,
papers, collars, chair legs, broken cups?  You may
say that, with the co-operation of my housekeeper,
a firmer line could be adopted towards some of them.
Perhaps so; but, alas! she is a willing accessory to
my weakness.  I fancy that once, a long time ago,
she must have thrown away a priceless MS. in an old
waistcoat; now she takes no risks with either.  In
principle it is a virtue; in practice I think I would
chance it.
</p>

<p>
It is a big cupboard; you wouldn't find many
rooms in London with a cupboard like that; and it
is included in the fixtures.  Yet in the ordinary way,
I suppose, I could not go on putting things in for
ever.  One day, however, I discovered that a family
of mice had heard of it too.  At first I was horrified.
Then I saw that it was all for the best; they might
help me to get rid of things.  In a week they had
eaten three pages of a nautical almanac; interesting
pages which would be of real help to a married man
at sea who wished to find the latitude by means of
two fixed stars, but which, to a bachelor on the
fourth floor, were valueless.
</p>

<p>
The housekeeper missed the point.  She went so
far as to buy me an extremely patent mousetrap.
It was a silly trap, because none of the mice knew
how to work it, although I baited it once with a cold
poached egg.  It is not for us to say what our
humbler brethren should like and dislike; we can
only discover by trial and error.  It occurred to me
that, if they <i>did</i> like cold poached eggs, I should be
able to keep on good terms with them, for I generally
had one over of a morning.  However, it turned out
that they preferred a vegetable diet&mdash;almanacs and
such....
</p>

<p>
The cupboard is nearly full.  I don't usually open
it to visitors, but perhaps you would care to look
inside for a moment?
</p>

<p>
That was once a top-hat.  What do you do with
your old top-hats?  Ah, yes, but then I only have a
housekeeper here at present....  That is a really
good pair of boots, only it's too small....  All that
paper over there?  Manuscript....  Well, you see
it <i>might</i> be valuable one day....
</p>

<p>
Broken batting glove.  Brown paper&mdash;I always
keep brown paper, it's useful if you're sending off a
parcel.  <i>Daily Mail</i> war map.  Paint-pot&mdash;doesn't
belong to me really, but it was left behind, and I got
tired of kicking it over.  Old letters&mdash;all the same
handwriting, bills probably....
</p>

<p>
Ah, no, they are not bills, you mustn't look at
those.  (I didn't know they were there&mdash;I swear I
didn't.  I thought I had burnt them.)  Of course I
see now that she was quite right....  Yes, that was
the very sweet one where she ... well, I knew even
then that ... I mean I'm not complaining at all,
we had a very jolly time....
</p>

<p>
Still, if it <i>had</i> been a little different&mdash;if that last
letter....  Well, I might by now have had a garden
of my own in which to have buried all this rubbish.
</p>

<h3>
THE POST BAG
</h3>

<p>
The other day I received a letter from some very
old friends of mine who live in Queen Victoria
Street.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Memo from Messrs Robinson, Cigar Shippers</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;We have been very anxious at not
having heard from you for nearly a year.  We trust
that you are in good health and that no illness or
bereavement has kept you from writing to us.  As you
know, it is our one ambition to satisfy you in the
matter of cigars, and your long silence on the
subject has naturally made us apprehensive.  Until we
hear from you, however, we shall refuse to believe
that the last lot you had from us were fatal.
</p>

<p>
Write to us frankly on the subject.  How did you
like the cigars we sent you last Christmas?  Were
they brown enough?  Did they smoke to a finish
strongly?  One third shipper, who went to Havana
especially to select this lot for you, writes us that in
this respect they were fit for an ambassador or (we
may add) an actor manager.  What is it, then, that
you are keeping back from us?  Perhaps you could
not light them?  If this was the case you should have
written to us before, and we would either have sent
you others of a more porous quality or forwarded you
our special gimlet, with which you could have brought
about the necessary draught.  Lay bare your heart
to us about these cigars.  Do you mind the green
spots?
</p>

<p>
A connoisseur like yourself will, of course, understand
that, though we guarantee that all the cigars
sent out by us <i>can</i> be smoked, yet the quality of the
cigar must necessarily vary with the price.  This
being so, perhaps you would care to try a slightly
higher-priced cigar this time.  We have referred to
our books and we see that last year we had the
pleasure of sending you a box of our famous <i>Flor di
Cabajo</i> at 8s. 6d. the hundred.  A nicer-coloured
cigar is the <i>Blanco Capello</i> at 9s. 6d.; but we are
hoping this Christmas that you will see your way to
giving our celebrated <i>Pompadoros</i>, at £5 the hundred,
a trial.  They have all the features of the <i>Cabajo</i>
which you approved, together with a breadth and
charm of flavour of their own.  May we send you a
box of these?
</p>

<p>
Our other special lines are:
</p>

<p>
The <i>I am Coming</i>&mdash;a spirited young cigar at
7s. 6d. the hundred, of which we enclose a sample.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Mañana</i>&mdash;prompt and impressive&mdash;10s. the
hundred.  (<i>Note.&mdash;This cigar has a band.</i>)
</p>

<p>
The <i>There and Back</i>&mdash;a good persevering cigar.
Only 10s. 6d.  Never comes undone.
</p>

<p>
However we are quite sure that none of these will
appeal to such a fastidious palate as yours must be
by now, and that we may confidently rely on your
order for a box of <i>Pompadoros</i>.
</p>

<p>
We may say that if you should unfortunately have
completely lost your taste for cigars we shall be happy
to send a box to any friend of yours.  Nothing could
make a more acceptable present, and nothing would
endear your friend or his relatives to you so
completely.
</p>

<p>
Now please write to us and tell us what you
feel about it.  We desire to make friends of our
customers; we do not wish our business to be a mere
commercial undertaking.  Talk to us as freely as you
would to your old college chum or fellow-clubman.
We insist on being of service to you.  Hoping to hear
from you within a day or two, we are, etc.,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
ROBINSON &amp; Co.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I replied at once:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
<i>Memo from Me</i>
</p>

<p>
DEAR OLD FRIEND,&mdash;A thousand thanks for your
sympathetic letter, and the book with the pictures.
Upon my word, I don't know which of the cigars I
like best; they all look so jolly.  Are they
photographs or water-colours?  I mean, are they really
as brown as that?  I like the tall, well set-up one on
page 7.  I see you say that it smokes strongly to a
finish.  That is all very well, Oswald, but what I
want to know is, Does it hang the beginning at
all?  Some of these cigars with a strong finish are
very slow forward, you know.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks for the sample.  Bless you, Rupert, I
didn't mind the green spots.  What do they mean?
That the cigar isn't quite ripe yet, I suppose.  But I
think you overdo the light brown spots.  Or are they
lucky, like those little strangers in the tea?
</p>

<p>
Yes, I think I must have some of your <i>Pompadoros</i>.
Send a box at Christmas to Mr Smithson, of 199
Cornhill, with our love&mdash;yours and mine and the
third shipper's.  I'll pay.  Not at all, Percy, it's a
pleasure.  He sent me some last Christmas; as it
happened, I left 'em in the train before I had smoked
one; but that wasn't his fault, was it?  I'll get some
for myself later on, if I may.  You won't mind waiting?
</p>

<p>
Dear old soul, you make a mistake when you say I
had some cigars from you last year.  I assure you I've
never heard of your name till to-day.  That was why
I didn't write on your birthday.  You'll forgive me,
won't you?
</p>

<p>
Now it is your turn to write.  Tell me all about
yourself, and your children, and the third shipper, and
the light brown spots and everything.  Good-bye!
Your very loving college chum.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The correspondence concluded thus:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
DEAR SIR,&mdash;We have received your esteemed order,
which shall be promptly executed.  Though the
<i>Pompadoros</i> will not be despatched to your friend till
Christmas, they are now being selected and will be put
aside to cool.
</p>

<p>
We have referred again to our books and find that
a box of our celebrated young <i>Cabajos</i> was indeed
despatched to your address last year, on the advice of
Mr Smithson, of 199 Cornhill.  This was why we were
so anxious at your long silence.  We are, etc.,
</p>

<p>
ROBINSON &amp; Co.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
DEAR OLD SPORT,&mdash;I am afraid you misunderstood
my last letter.  The <i>Pompadoros</i> are for myself; it
was a hundred <i>I am Comings</i> which I wanted for my
friend Mr Smithson.  I must tell you a funny thing
about him; as a friend of both of us you will be
interested.  He collects cigar bands!  I have no use
for them myself; so, if it isn't troubling you, would
you send the <i>Pompadoro</i> bands to <i>him</i>, as the <i>I am
Comings</i> haven't any of their own?  You might put
them on the cigars to save packing.  Ever your
devoted fellow-clubman.
</p>

<h3>
GOING OUT
</h3>

<p>
Alone, I can get through an At Home with a
certain amount of credit.  No doubt, I make
mistakes; no doubt people look at me and say: "Who
is that person sitting all by himself in the corner, and
keeping on eating muffins?" but at any rate I can
make the function a tolerable one.  When, however,
I flutter in under the wing of my sister-in-law, with
my hair nicely brushed and my tie pulled straight
(she having held a review on the doorstep), then it is
another matter altogether.  It is then that I feel how
necessary it is to say the right thing.  Beatrice has
pretty ears, but they are long-distance ones.  We
drifted apart immediately but I was sure she was
listening.
</p>

<p>
I found myself introduced to a tall, athletic-looking
girl.
</p>

<p>
"There's a great crowd, isn't there?" I said.
"Can I find you some tea, or anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please," she said, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
I noted the smile, and thanked heaven that I had
read my Lady Grove.  In the ordinary way I say to
strangers: "Will you take a dish of tea with me?"
but just in time Lady Grove had warned me that this
was wrong.  Left to myself I hit upon the word
"find."  "Can I find you some tea?"  It gives
the idea of pursuit.  And the "or anything" rounds
it off well&mdash;as much as to say, "If I <i>should</i> happen to
come back with a sardine on toast, don't blame <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
I found some tea after a long struggle, but by that
time I had lost the athlete.  It was a pity, because I
was going to have talked to her about Surrey's
victory over Kent at ladies' hockey.  I don't know
anything about hockey, but it's obvious that Surrey
must play Kent some time, and it would be an even
chance that Surrey would win.  The good
conversationalist takes risks cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
Well, the international having disappeared, I was
going to drink the tea myself, when I caught
Beatrice's eye on me.
</p>

<p>
"Will you have some tea?" I said to my neighbour.
</p>

<p>
"I think a little coffee, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
I pressed the tea into the hand of a retired colonel,
and hurried off.  Now that shows you.  Alone, I
should have quoted <i>The Lancet</i> on coffee microbes,
and insisted on her having my cup of tea.  This
would have led us easily and naturally to a conversation
on drinks and modern journalism.  We should
have become friends.  I should have had an invitation
from her mother to lunch; and I should have
smoked two of her father's best cigars.
</p>

<p>
As it was I said "Certainly," fetched the coffee,
coughed, and observed that there was rather a crowd.
She said "Yes" and turned away to somebody else.
Two good cigars thrown away because of Beatrice!
</p>

<p>
I was slowly recovering from my loss when
Beatrice herself came up to say that she wanted to
introduce me to a very nice girl called Jane
something.  In the ordinary way, very nice girls aren't
called Jane anything, so here evidently was
something exceptional.  I buttoned my coat boldly, and
followed her, unbuttoning it nervously on the way.
</p>

<p>
"Here he is," she said, and left us.
</p>

<p>
This is what they call introducing.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do?" I started.
</p>

<p>
"I've heard such a lot about you," began Jane
brightly.
</p>

<p>
I never know what to say to that.  There must be
a right answer, if only Lady Grove would tell us.  As it
was I said "Thank you."
</p>

<p>
That felt wrong, so I added, "So have I."
</p>

<p>
"About you," I explained hurriedly.  To myself I
said, "You know you're not really carrying this off
well.  It's idle to pretend that you are."
</p>

<p>
"<i>What</i> have you heard, I wonder?" beamed Jane.
</p>

<p>
Only that her name was Jane something.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" I said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you <i>must</i> tell me!"
</p>

<p>
"I mean, I've heard friends of yours mention your
name."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said disappointedly, "I thought you
meant&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, of course, everybody has heard of
Jane&mdash;h'r'r'm&mdash;of Miss&mdash;er, um&mdash;I think my sister-in-law&mdash;yes,
thank you, we have a train to catch, oh, must you
really go?&mdash;er&mdash;good-bye."
</p>

<p>
I staggered away in pursuit of Beatrice.  She
dragged me up to an American girl, as I judged her.
</p>

<p>
"Here he is," she said, and passed on.
</p>

<p>
"So glad to make your acquaintance," said the American.
</p>

<p>
There <i>is</i> no answer to that, I know.  I ignored it
altogether, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen the Budget?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  What's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you must see that."
</p>

<p>
"I will.  We'll go to-morrow.  Where is it?"
</p>

<p>
I don't think Americans see as much of Addison
Road as they ought to.  I gave the usual guide-book
directions for getting there, and was just beginning to
be interested when I saw Beatrice's inquiring look.
"Are you behaving nicely?" it said.  I passed on
hastily.
</p>

<p>
I was very lonely for a while after that.  Three
times I got a plate of cucumber sandwiches safely
into a corner, and three times a sisterly eye dragged
us out again.  After the third failure I saw that it
was hopeless, so I wandered about and tried to decide
which was the ugliest hat in the room.  A man is the
only possible judge in a competition of that sort.  A
woman lets herself be prejudiced by such facts as
that it is so fashionable, or that she saw one just like
it in Bond Street, my dear, at five guineas.
</p>

<p>
I had narrowed the competitors down to five, two
of which were, on form, certain for a place, when I
turned round and saw, in a corner behind me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(I don't know if you will believe me)&mdash;
</p>

<p>
A man with a plate of cucumber sandwiches!
</p>

<p>
I rubbed my eyes in amazement.  A man ... at
an At Home ... sitting down and eating
cucum&mdash;&mdash;  Why, where was his sister-in-law?
</p>

<p>
There was only one thing to be done.  The
favourite in my competition (green, pink hoops) was
disengaged for the moment.  I went up to the man,
took him by the arm, and dragged him away from
his corner.  He still held the plate in his hand, and I
helped myself to a sandwich.  "Must introduce you,"
I whispered in his ear.  "Famous prize-winner."  We
pushed our way up to the lady.
</p>

<p>
"Here he is," I said.
</p>

<p>
And I looked round triumphantly for Beatrice.
</p>

<h3>
AN AWKWARD CASE
</h3>

<p>
This is one of those really difficult cases (being
the seventh of the quarter) where the editor of
<i>The Perfect Lady</i> simply has to ask his readers what
<i>A.</i> should have done.  The sort of reply that will be
given is; "<i>A.</i> should have carried it off
easily."  Remarks like that are unhesitatingly included
among the "<i>Answers adjudged idiotic.</i>"
</p>

<p>
The thing happened in the train, while I was
returning to town after a couple of nights in the
country.  The scene&mdash;an empty carriage, myself in
one corner.  On the seat opposite lay my dressing-case.
I had unlocked it in order to take out a book,
and was deep in this when we stopped at a wayside
station.  The opening of the door woke me suddenly;
somebody was daring to get into my compartment.
Luckily one only&mdash;a girl.
</p>

<p>
Women always wish to travel with their backs to
the engine; in the event of an accident you don't
have so far to go.  She sat down next to my bag.
Naturally I jumped up (full of politeness), seized the
handle, and swung the thing up on to the rack.
</p>

<p>
That, at least, was the idea.  It was carried out
literally, but not figuratively.  The bag went up
beautifully; only&mdash;on its way it opened, and the
contents showered down upon the seats, the floor,
and&mdash;yes, even upon her....
</p>

<p>
The contents....
</p>

<p>
This story shows upon what small accidents great
events turn.  If I had only been going instead of
coming back!  A couple of clean shirts, a few
snow-white collars, a pair of sky-blue pyjamas perfectly
creased, socks and handkerchiefs neatly folded&mdash;one
would not have minded all these being thrown before
a stranger; at least, not so much.  Going, too, the
brushes and things would have been in their proper
compartments; they would have swung up on to the
rack.  I feel convinced that, if the thing had
happened going, I should have carried it off all right.
We should have laughed together, we should have
told each other of similar accidents which had happened
to friends, and we should have then drifted into
a general conversation about the weather.  Going ....
</p>

<p>
But coming back!  It was an early train, and I
had packed hurriedly.  The brushes and things had
been put in anyhow, and they came out anyhow.
There was an absurd piece of shaving soap wrapped
up in one of "An Englishman's Letters."  (I always
think that things wrapped up like that look so
horrible.)  There was a shaving-brush in a pink
piece of <i>Globe</i> lying on the sky-blue pyjamas (and
the pyjamas all anyhow).  Then the collars.  I do
think a dirty collar ... besides I had screwed them
up tightly in order to get them in....  Of course
she wouldn't understand that....
</p>

<p>
Socks.  Now this is too awful.  I don't know if I
can mention this.  Well&mdash;well then, they had two
wretched sock-suspenders attached to them.  Odd
ones, as I live&mdash;black and pink.  You see, I had got
up in a hurry, and...
</p>

<p>
Handkerchiefs.  They had been shoved into the
pumps.  I had been pressed for space, and...
</p>

<p>
You know, there were about thirty-nine different
things that I wanted to explain to her.  In novels
the hero is always throwing upon the heroine an
expressive glance, full of meaning.  That is what I
wanted.  There is probably, if one only knew it, a
shrug, a wave of the hand, which really does express
the fact that you were coming and not going, and
took in <i>The Times</i> yourself, and had packed in a
hurry, and ...
</p>

<p>
If I could only have handed a Statement to the
Press....
</p>

<p>
And I have yet to mention the unkindest blow of
all.  The evening clothes themselves, the only
presentable things, stayed in the bag.  If they had
come out too, then I might have done something.  I
should have left them to the last&mdash;conspicuous upon
the floor.  Then I should have picked them up
slowly, examined them, and nodded at the braid on
the trousers as if to say, "Hang it, that's the sort of
man I am really."  I think, if they had come out
too, I could still have carried the thing off....
</p>

<p>
What should <i>A.</i> do?  Should he say to the girl,
"Close your eyes and count twenty, and see what
somebody's brought you," and then, while she was
not looking, push the clothes under the seat?
Should he be quite calm, and, stretching in front of
her, say, "<i>My</i> sock, I think," or politely, "Perhaps
you would care to look at a piece of <i>The Daily Mail</i>?"
Should he disown the thing altogether?  "I'm very
sorry.  Let <i>me</i> put them back for you."  That
would have been a master-stroke.
</p>

<p>
Or should he, to divert attention, pull the alarm,
and pay his five pounds like a man?
</p>

<p>
But what <i>did</i> <i>A.</i> do?
</p>

<p>
Alas!  He did nothing heroic.  For one moment
he stood there; then he pulled down the bag, fell on
his knees, and began throwing the things in madly.
He picked up the bag, locked it, and put it on the
rack.
</p>

<p>
Then he turned to the girl.  Now he was going to
have spoken to her.  An apology, a laugh&mdash;yes, even
now he might have carried it off.
</p>

<p>
Only he happened to look up ... and he saw
above her head the cord of his pyjamas dangling
over the edge of the rack.

  REVERIE

<p class="poem">
  Dear Amaryllis,&mdash;(may I call you that?<br>
  Seeing I do not know your proper name;<br>
  And if I did, it might be something dull&mdash;<br>
  Like Madge).  I offer you my broken heart,<br>
  Knowing that if you do not want the thing<br>
  You will not hesitate to mention it:<br>
  Dear Amaryllis, will you please be mine?<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We met, 'twas at a dance, ten days ago;<br>
  And after sundry smiles and bows from me,<br>
  And other rather weary smiles from you,<br>
  And certain necessary calculations,<br>
  We hit at last upon the second extra,<br>
  And made an assignation for the same.<br>
  "I shall be at this corner here," you said:<br>
  And I "Right O" or words to that effect.<br>
  But when the dance came round we both were tired,<br>
  So sat it out instead beneath a palm<br>
  (Which probably was just as well for you,<br>
  And since I love you, just as well for me).<br>
  We talked, but what about I can't remember&mdash;<br>
  Save this: that you were rather keen on golf;<br>
  That I had never been to Scarborough;<br>
  And both of us thought well of Bernard Shaw.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We talked; but all the time I looked at you,<br>
  And wondered much what inspiration led<br>
  Your nose to tilt at just that perfect angle;<br>
  And wondered how on earth you did your hair;<br>
  And why your eyes were blue, when it was black;<br>
  And why&mdash;a hundred other different things.<br>
  Until at last, another dance beginning,<br>
  You left me lonely; whereupon I went<br>
  Back to the supper-room, and filled a glass<br>
  And drank, and lit a cigarette, and sighed,<br>
  And asked the waiter had he been in love,<br>
  And told the waiter, Yes, I <i>am</i> in love,<br>
  And gave him twopence, and went home to bed.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  <i>Am</i> I in love?  Well, no, I hardly think so.<br>
  For one, I'm much too happy as I am;<br>
  For two, I shall forget you by to-morrow;<br>
  For three, I do not care about your friends,<br>
  The men you danced with&mdash;bounders, all of them;<br>
  For four and five and six and all the rest,<br>
  I'm fairly sure we shall not meet again.<br>
  Not that I mind.  No, as I said before,<br>
  I'm very much too happy as I am.<br>
  Besides, I shall forget you by to-morrow.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then why this letter?  Well, two incidents<br>
  Have led me to it.  Here you have them both.<br>
  First, then, that sitting in my rooms last week,<br>
  Sitting and smoking, thinking&mdash;not of you,<br>
  Not altogether, but of many things,<br>
  Politics, football, dinner and tobacco&mdash;<br>
  Quite suddenly, this thought occurred to me:<br>
  "By Jove, I wish I had a little dog,<br>
  A terrier, an Irish terrier,<br>
  I wonder if the landlord would object."<br>
  And thinking thus, I rose and sighed, and bent<br>
  To take my boots off.  Had a mouse appeared<br>
  I could have loved it in my loneliness.<br>
  Had but the humblest cockroach shown his head,<br>
  I think I would have said "Good-night" to it.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  This too (I give it you for what it's worth):<br>
  Next morning, passing through St James's Park,<br>
  A morning for the gods, all blue and white,<br>
  I heard what, strictly, should have been a skylark,<br>
  (But, probably, was quite a common bird)<br>
  Offering up its very soul to heaven.<br>
  Then suddenly I stopped and cried, "Oh, Lord!<br>
  Oh, Lord!" I cried, "I wish it were the spring."<br>
</p>

<p class="thought">
  * * * * * * *<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So there you have it.  Now it's off my chest.<br>
  Just for one moment you upset me slightly,<br>
  Disturbed my usual calm serenity,<br>
  Got in my head, and set me vainly wishing<br>
  For April, and the country, and one other...<br>
  But that is over.  I am whole again.<br>
  Good-bye!  I shall not send this letter now.<br>
  I find I have forgotten you already.<br>

<h3>
RETROSPECT
</h3>

<p>
Looking back on the past year I can see that
it has been (as usual) one of noble endeavour&mdash;frequently
frustrated, but invariably well meant.
In accordance with the custom of the newspapers I
have set down here its record of achievement in the
different provinces of art, bicycling and the like;
and I offer this to the public in full confidence of its
sympathy and appreciation.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
ART
</p>

<p>
We have had our photographs taken for the first
time for many years, and if the result isn't art I
don't know what is.  The photographer said:
"Would you like them <i>en silhouette</i> or
straight-fronted?"  We said in French that we had thought
of <i>carte-de-visite</i>.  The result is a sort of
three-quarter face with one wing forward, and the man
insists that we must have looked like that once.  The
only other achievement in the world of art is a
moleskin waistcoat of some distinction.  I had no idea
that moles were that colour, but the man swore that
when you had taken the feathers out of them you
found quite a different coloured skin underneath.
As he has been there and I haven't, I cannot argue
with him.  Altogether a good year for art.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
BICYCLING
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the year our eldest brother sold
our bicycle for a sovereign and gave the sovereign to
our second brother.  A bad year for bicycling therefore.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
SCIENCE
</p>

<p>
(I thought for the moment science began with a C,
which is why it comes in here.)
</p>

<p>
Several important discoveries have been made in
the year.  For instance, the small white raspberries
in tapioca pudding are <i>meant</i> to be there; you always
thought that they had got in from some other dish,
when the cook wasn't looking.  And when your
watch gains a foot you don't put the regulator to A
because it is advancing, but to R because you want
to retard it.  (Or else the other way round&mdash;I have
forgotten again.  Anyhow, I found out that I had
been doing it wrong.)  Another discovery made in
the early part of the year was the meaning of the
phrase "Bank Rate Unchanged," but that is too
technical to explain here.  A record year for science.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
FINANCE
</p>

<p>
The old system of keeping no accounts and never
filling in the counterfoils of cheques again answered
admirably.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
GAMES
</p>

<p>
The past year marks an epoch in the history of
games.  We have retired from football and are not
the cricketer we were; but, on the other hand,
we have made immense strides in croquet.  We
improve slowly at billiards.  In November we potted
the red rather neatly, and everybody said, "There's
no getting away from that&mdash;he <i>must</i> have meant it."  As
a matter of fact ... but it would spoil it to
explain.  In the latter part of the year we could have
shown you a trick or two at tennis.  That is all,
except that I can no longer jump the ancestral
herbaceous border, as the gardener keeps on
discovering.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
HYDROSTATICS
</p>

<p>
Archimedes' Principle&mdash;that if a heavy body gets
into a cold bath quickly an equal amount of water
gets out on to the mat quickly&mdash;was demonstrated
daily, to the complete dissatisfaction of the man on
the floor below, who, however, made a still more
important discovery in this interesting branch of
dynamics&mdash;viz. that water does not find its own
level, but prefers something about ten feet lower
down.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
INDIGO
</p>

<p>
Indigo has maintained its <i>status quo</i> throughout
the year.  There have been occasions during this time
when we had almost decided to be an Indigo planter
in Assam rather than stick it in this beastly country.
On each occasion the weather cleared just before we
had packed the sandwiches.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
MUSIC
</p>

<p>
Space and time alike fail us to tell of our notable
triumphs upon the pianola in the year that has just
elapsed.  We have played the Sonata Appassionata
and "Shuffling Jasper" with equal <i>verve</i> and
<i>chiaroscuro</i>.  The fruitness and nutty flavour of our
rendering of Remorse&mdash;Valse Tzigane, No. 1,192,999, kindly
return by the end of the month&mdash;will never be
forgotten.  In July one of the black notes stuck down
and refused to budge for some time; but we got it up
at last with a potted-meat opener.  I say, I don't
think much of Liszt.  He has pace and staying power
and is a good strider; quite a useful man over timber
he might be; but he is a little lacking in&mdash;what shall I
say, <i>Adagio con molto expressione ma non troppo</i>, if
you know what I mean.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
PETS
</p>

<p>
Walter, the white mouse, perished in May.  The
doctor said it was too much exercise on an
empty&mdash;well, he put it rather crudely.  You know what
doctors are.  And you know how white mice <i>will</i>
exercise.  The tailor said Walter was too small to
make up into a white waistcoat, even an evening one,
and that he would be hopeless as a tie.  I advertised
for a white mole, but they seem to be rare.
Altogether it was a sad year for pets.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
THOUGHT
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the past year was, above all, a year for
thought.  To the pursuit of thought we devoted
many days in many positions.  Some people would
find it impossible to think properly immediately
after breakfast but we proved that, given a sufficiently
comfortable chair, the impossible could be achieved,
that one could be as thoughtfully busy in the
morning as in the afternoon.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
XYLONITE
</p>

<p>
We did not do any of this.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
YCLEPT
</p>

<p>
We were yclept every morning punctually at eight
(and arose punctually at nine thirty) throughout the
year.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
ZEUGMA
</p>

<p>
I suppose you thought I couldn't do X. Y. Z.  Well,
this is just to show you.  In the ordinary way, of
course, I should have referred to the zeugma under
music.  We ordered a low-strung one last month, but
it has not yet been delivered.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
So much for my record of the past year.  Reading
it over now I feel that I have not spent the last twelve
months in vain.  At the end of them I can say truthfully
that I am, if not a year wiser, at least a year
older, a year fatter.  And still a happy bachelor.
</p>

<h3>
LETTERS TO CHARLES
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Can you lend me a penny?  I
have just been making up my accounts for the
day (the idea occurred to me suddenly; it's a thing
I have never done before) and I am seven shillings
and a penny out.  The seven shillings I don't mind,
but the penny worries me dreadfully.  I think that if
you lent me another one I should gradually be able to
settle down again.
</p>

<p>
I lie when I say I have never made up accounts
before&mdash;I did it on one memorable occasion years and
years ago.  When John and I were at school we had
certain expenses, such as subscriptions to the mission
and to various house competitions, train fares,
masters' wedding presents, haircutting and so on,
which did not come out of our pocket money or tips,
but which were specially sent to us from home.  To
save the trouble of this we were given, at the
beginning of one term, five pounds to see us through all
these expenses, with the understanding that we were
to account for it afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"Afterwards" meant the holidays, which (to
begin with) were a long way off.  As they came
nearer we consoled ourselves with the thought that
the required "account" was a mere formality which
would probably not be insisted upon; the actual
money had been spent&mdash;which after all was the main
thing, the idea of the whole proceeding, so to say.
To wish to linger over the details of its gradual
dissolution would be morbid.  However to our horror a
day did come in the holidays when we were
peremptorily ordered to provide our account and to
hand over the balance.
</p>

<p>
There is, as you know, Charles, never any difficulty
about providing an account&mdash;the trouble is to hand
over the balance.  In our case the balance was exactly
nothing, we had not a penny in our pockets.  The
money had been spent all right, an unusual number
of masters having been married that term (some of
them for the third or fourth time in the year), but we
could not possibly make up our accounts so that to a
farthing the two sides balanced.  It would look so
unnatural.  How could we march solemnly into the
library and say "By a perfectly amazing coincidence
the money you gave us was just precisely the amount
which the circumstances demanded.  There is no
balance."
</p>

<p>
It was a very hot afternoon, and we were unhappy.
The matter of the accounts was not the only shadow
which hung over us.  John had a fox terrier&mdash;so had
I; but whereas my dog was a Little Englander, and
stayed at home, John's was an Imperialist, who
roamed the country.  He had disappeared again the
night before, and had been observed in the morning
in a village three miles away.  Thither toiled John
in search of him that hot afternoon, his heart torn
between his love for his dog and his duty to his
parents.  And Rags and I remained at home to see
what we could make of finance.
</p>

<p>
We made but little of it.  The more I thought of it,
the more impossible it seemed to say that every
penny (no more, no less) of the five pounds had been
spent properly.  One idea I had which touched
genius&mdash;namely, to furnish an account for five pounds
ten (say) and point out that the balance was owing
to us.  Ours was always a great family for ideas.
But you see the weak spot, Charles&mdash;that we hadn't
demanded the ten shillings long ago.
</p>

<p>
And then John returned.  No, he had not found
his dog, but he had found a shilling in the road.  He
had spent (he simply had to spend, he said) a penny
ha'penny on refreshment, but the tenpence ha'penny
he had brought back joyfully.  And in the evening a
beautiful account (on the double-entry system) and
tenpence ha'penny balance were handed over with
ceremony.
</p>

<p>
So much for finance, Charles.  Now I've got some
news for you.  <i>I've just had a nephew</i>!  (Uncle
doing well.)  Did you know?  Look here, we'll
arrange a sporting match between him and your son
over hurdles for 1922.  Your boy will still be a year
older, but, bless you, I don't mind that.  My
nephew is so ugly at present that I feel he must be
intended for the highest honours at something.
Probably hurdles.  Of course if either of us perishes
in the meantime the nominations become void.
("The nominations become void"&mdash;did you notice
that?  Quite the sportsman.)
</p>

<p>
What sort of weather are you having?  I ask
because the weather differs according to the locality,
and down at Castle Bumpbrook it may be quite fine,
while it is raining here, and <i>vice versa</i>.  Why is this?
Why shouldn't the weather be the same everywhere?
Something to do with the solstices, I believe.  What
is a solstice?  (I have asked you no end of questions
in this letter, and I don't suppose you will answer one
of them.)
</p>

<p>
Do you grow oranges at Castle?  (Forgive the
familiarity.)  Exhausted by my divings into the
remote and wicked past, I have just eaten about six.
I get through quite a dozen a day.  The fact is I
heard a doctor say the other night that they were
extremely good for the complexion&mdash;or else extremely
bad, I couldn't quite catch which.  He spoke very
indistinctly.  It was a pity that I missed what seems
to have been the important word; it wouldn't have
mattered so much about the "extremely."  However,
I go on eating them, and if one day you turn up
in town and find me a full-blown mulatto, you will
know that the word was "bad."  I shall become a
sort of test case, like "Wreford <i>v.</i> Partington
(1883)."  Eminent people will refer to me.  How nice to be
referred to&mdash;not that it would be the first time.
"Refer to drawer," I remember on my cheques at
Cambridge.  That, sir, was me.
</p>

<p>
Do you know, I made up the names Wreford and
Partington on the spur of the moment.  The names
are simple enough, but I think the combination is
wonderful.  There must have been such a case in 1883.
Who do you think Wreford was?  I fancy he was a
small chandler, and he fell down the coal shoot of
Partington's in Cannon Street.  James Partington,
the senior partner, said (fairly enough) that a great
firm like his, which had branches all over England
(including Norwich), must have coal some time, if
they were to cope successfully with increasing foreign
competition, which, owing to the present Gov&mdash;&mdash;  Oh
no, this was 1883; I forgot.  Well, anyhow, he
said they must have coal.  Wreford retorted that he
didn't mind their putting coal down their shoot, but
when it came to including respectable citizens of
London&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
You remember the excitement when the case came
on?  We were only babies then, but I have a
recollection that my nurse was a pro-Partington.
Wreford won, but as he was heavily fined for having
knowingly caused a crowd to collect it did him little
good, poor man.
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.  Write to me soon and tell me all about
Castle Bumpbrook.  What a glorious name.  I often
say it to myself.  It is the only strong language I ever
use now.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Many thanks for your definition
of a solstice.  Is it really?  Fancy!  By answering
one of my questions you become a unique correspondent.
Nobody else answers questions in a letter.
Sometimes, of course, one is asked, "What train are
you coming down by on Saturday?  Let me know
at once."  But the proper thing to do in such a case
is to wait till Saturday afternoon, and then wire
"Just missed the two twenty-two.  Hope to catch
the next."  Questions in letters are mostly rhetorical;
which is why I ask you, How, oh, how could you
have the nerve to head your paper "Castle Bumpbrook,"
and fill it with arguments against the Budget?
It is hardly decent.  You know, I doubt if you ought
even to have heard of the Budget at Castle Bumpbrook.
</p>

<p>
What I expect from you is pleasant gossip about the
miller's daughter.  Is she engaged yet to the
postman?  Has the choir begun to practise the Christmas
anthem?  When does Mrs Bates' husband come out?
These are the things you should tell me.  Tell me, too,
of your simple recreations.  Has whist reached
Castle Bumpbrook yet?  It is a jolly game for four.
One person deals and you turn up the last card, and
then the&mdash;&mdash;  But I must send you a book about it.
</p>

<p>
I have been having a correspondence with my landlord
as to what I should do in case of fire.  Of course,
if your little cottage got alight, you would simply hop
out of the window on to the geranium bed; but it is
different in London.  Particularly when you are on
the top floor.  Well, he tells me that I can easily get
out on to Mr Podby's roof next door ... and so
home.  This is certainly comforting, but&mdash;Podby!  I
don't like it, Charles.  Supposing anything happened,
just think how it would look in the papers.  "The
unfortunate gentleman was last seen upon Mr Podby's
roof...."  No, I shall have to go for the
drain-pipe at the back.
</p>

<p>
Look here, I have two stories to tell you.  One is
quite true, the other isn't.  Which will you have
first?  All right, the truth.
</p>

<p>
When I first came to town I was very&mdash;I mean I
believed everything I was told.  One Sunday I met
a small but elderly gentleman on the Embankment,
who asked me the way to the German Embassy.  He
had the river to his south, so obviously all the
embassies were in the other direction.  I pointed
vaguely towards the north.  He thanked me and
said that&mdash;&mdash;  (By the way, do you prefer <i>oratio
recta</i>?  I forgot to ask you.) Well, then, he said:
</p>

<p>
"The embassies would be shut on a Sunday, hein?"
</p>

<p>
I said: "Doubtless."
</p>

<p>
He said: "I am a Professor at Heidelberg.  I
have just arrived in London, and I have no money.
To-morrow I go to my Embassy and get some.
Meanwhile, could you lend me five shillings?"
</p>

<p>
Charles, in those days I was very&mdash;&mdash;  Well, I
gave him half-a-crown.
</p>

<p>
He said: "I should like to pay this back to you."
</p>

<p>
I said: "Quite so.  That is the idea."
</p>

<p>
"Then would you give me your card, so that I
can send you the money to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
Charles, I&mdash;&mdash;  You see, I had just had some cards
printed.  They had "Mr" on for the first time.  I
was very&mdash;&mdash;  Well, I gave him one.
</p>

<p>
That ends the first scene.  An interval of nearly
five years elapses, and we come to last Saturday.  I
was walking through the Green Park, when a small
but elderly gentleman came up to me.
</p>

<p>
He said: "Is this the way to the School of Music?"
</p>

<p>
I said: "Which one do you want?  There is the
Guildhall School, and the Royal College, and the
Royal Academy, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He thought for a moment, and then he said in
German the German for "Do you speak German?"
(My dear Charles, I <i>can't</i> spell it).  I said "Nein."
</p>

<p>
He considered a little, and said, "Parlez-vous
français?"  I said&mdash;(What's the French for "Not
very well"?  Well, that's what I said).
</p>

<p>
At this his face brightened.  He drew a long
breath, and began:
</p>

<p>
"I am a Professor of Music at Heidelberg&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Charles, I had to interrupt him.  I simply couldn't
help it.  I said; "Then you owe me half-a-crown."  He
stopped, and looked at me with a sort of sad
dignity.  Then he turned round with a sigh and
plodded wearily across the park.  And, oh, I do hope
he had better luck with somebody else, because he
has been at it for five years now, and it must be a
heart-breaking life.  His hair had gone quite grey
since I saw him last.
</p>

<p>
Charles, you do see that that is a true story, don't
you?  If I had been making it up, I should have
said that he gave me back my own card as a reference.
I wonder why he didn't.  I suppose it had got rather
dirty after five years.
</p>

<p>
Do you want the other one now?  It is the merest
anecdote, and Hilda told it me, and I know it's not
true.
</p>

<p>
She has a cat called "Didums poor little kitty wee,
then"; you put the accent on the "then," and spread
it out as long as you can.  Well, Didums, etc., goes
about eating moths; a curious diet for a cat, but I
believe it keeps them thin.  He swallowed them
whole, you know, and Hilda told him how cruel it
was.  She seems to have spoken of the sufferings of
the imprisoned ones in the most moving terms.
Anyhow she found Didums next day up in her
bedroom remorsefully eating a sealskin coat.
</p>

<p>
I am surprised at Hilda.  If she is not careful her
baby will grow up a journalist.  I have seen him
since he came back from you.  This time I approached
from the west, and I noticed a great difference.  He
is certainly a fine child, and as he let me put him to
sleep I love him.  After all, looks don't matter
tuppence to a man.  The great thing is wisdom.
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.  I remember
a General Knowledge Paper in my Mays.  One of the
questions was "Give a list of the chief coaling-stations
you would pass on your way to New Zealand."  The
only two I could think of were Cyprus and Rickett
Smith.  I never heard whether I got full marks:
probably not.  But since that day knowledge has
come for I have a friend in the Admiralty.  He was
a very high wrangler the year I wasn't, and just as
Fisher is the man behind the First Lord, so he is the
man behind Fisher; at least, he tells me so.  And
he buys his tobacco by the knot&mdash;or is it the quid?&mdash;and
plays the Hague Convention at bridge, and (as I
say) knows all the coaling-stations from Cambridge to
New Zealand.
</p>

<p>
Wisdom Lingers.  What a splendid title for a
novel.  You would expect a fine moral tale, and it
would turn out to be the story of the Lingers family.
Wisdom K. Lingers.  There you have the essence
of successful book-naming.  I hand the idea to you,
Charles, in the certainty that you would steal it
anyhow.
</p>

<p>
Do you know anything about gas?  I buy a lot
every week for my geyser.  You get about 1000 for
half-a-crown.  A thousand what?  I don't know;
but I like to take part in these great business transactions,
and I am now writing to ask if they could make
it 1200 seeing that I am a regular customer.  No
harm in asking.
</p>

</p>

<p>
DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Do you truly want me to recommend
you something to read?  Well, why not try
the serial story in some ha'penny paper?  There you
get a glimpse of the real thing.  I turned idly to
"Lepers in Israel" (or whatever it is called) last
night, and found myself suddenly up to the neck in
tragedy.  Lord Billingham ...
</p>

<p>
Charles, you're a married man, tell me if it really
is so.  The gentle Pamela is urged by a cruel mother
to espouse Lord Billingham for his money's sake.
Lord B. is a vulgar brute, I'm afraid; in any case
Pamela is all for young Prendergast; but one must
be sensible, you know, and money does make a
difference, doesn't it?  So she becomes Lady
Billingham; and a year or two later Prendergast
comes back from South Africa to find that it is he
who is the real Lord Billingham after all.  (I got
most of this from the "synopsis," which enables you
to start the story now, so I can't say how it was they
overlooked him in the first place.)  It would be
extremely cruel (you see that, Charles?) to talk about
it, because Pamela would then become plain Mrs
Stubbs, and no money at all; so Prendergast decides
to say nothing to anybody.  But he was reckoning
without Mrs Trevelyan, no less.  Mrs Trevelyan
finds out the secret, and threatens Prendergast that
she will tell everybody that he is the real Lord
Billingham unless he marries her.  So of course he
has to.
</p>

<p>
It is at this moment that we meet Captain Pontifax.
Captain Pontifax is in love with Mrs Trevelyan,
at least he thinks he is, and he says that if she doesn't
marry him he will let on about what happened to Mr
Trevelyan, who was supposed to have died of old
age.  At the same time the news gets out that
Prendergast is really Lord Billingham, and so Pamela
does become Mrs Stubbs; and, as Prendergast
cannot honourably withdraw from the alliance he is
about to contract with Mrs Trevelyan, it looks as
though she is going to be Lady Billingham.  But on
the eve of the wedding a body is found at the
bottom of the old chalk quarry....  Whose? ...
</p>

<p>
What I want to hear from you, Charles, is, Do
people always get married for this sort of reason?
Are you really the Duke of Norfolk, and did Kitty
discover your secret and threaten to disclose it?
Oh, you coward!  I don't mind anybody knowing
that I am the true Earl Billingham.
</p>

<p>
About the body.  We shall know to-morrow.  I
think it's Captain Pontifax myself, but I will send
you a telegram.
</p>

<p>
Are you an authority on dress?  A man got into
my carriage on the District to-day wearing a top-hat,
a frock-coat, and brown boots.  Is that right?  I
ask it seriously, because the point I want to
discover is this: Supposing you suddenly found that
you had nothing in the house but brown boots and a
frock-coat, would a bowler or a topper be the better
way out of it?
</p>

<p>
You see the idea, Charles.  If you add a bowler
then the thing you have to explain away is the coat.
I don't quite see how that is to be managed; you
could only put it down to absent-mindedness.  But
if you add a topper then you have only the brown
boots to account for.  This could be done in a variety
of ways&mdash;a foggy morning, a sudden attack of
colour-blindness, or that your mother asked you to
wear the thickest ones, dear, and never mind about
the silly fashion.  It is an interesting point which
has never been dealt with properly in the
etiquette-books.  You and I are agreed upon the topper, it
seems.
</p>

<p>
I went to a play last Tuesday.  It was not bad,
but the funniest scene happened right at the
beginning, when I watched an American buy a seat at the
box-office.  They gave him J13., and he only
discovered it after he had paid for it, and had put his
change carefully away.  Do you know, Charles, he
nearly cried.  The manager assured him there was
nothing in it; people sat there every night, and
were heard of again.  It was no good.  He got his
money back, and went away looking quite miserable.
Isn't it childish?  I am going to be married on
Friday, 13th May, just to show.  When is that?
Sickening if it's not for years and years.  I have a
patent calendar somewhere which tells you the date
for any year up to 1928.  I never know why it should
stop there; something to do with the golden number
getting too big.  It won't go backwards either,
which is a pity, because I have always wanted to
know on what day of the week I was born.  Nobody
will tell me.  It was one of the lucky days I am sure.
How can I find out?
</p>

<p>
(<i>To-morrow.</i>)&mdash;I have just sent you a telegram to
say that it was Sir Richard Tressider's body.  Strange
that you hadn't thought of him.  Charles, I felt
very shy in the post office.  Yes, about Castle
Bumpbrook.  She didn't believe there was such a
place; I offered to bet.  We went through the
Telegraph Directory together.  Do you know, you
come in the Castles, not in the Bumps at all.  (Put
me among the Bumps.)  Something ought to be
done about it.  I always thought Castle was your
Christian name, kind of.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it was Sir Richard's corpse.  It occurs to me
now that you will get this letter a day after the
telegram.  How did I put it?
</p>

<p>
"Body believed to be that of Sir Richard Tressider.
Death certified as by drowning.  Inspector Stockley
suspects foul play."
</p>

<p>
An elevenpenny touch, Charles, and I never
signed it, and you'll wonder what on earth it's all
about.  Probably you will dismiss it as a joke, and
that would be elevenpence thrown away.  That
cannot be allowed.  You can get a telegram repeated
at half-price, can't you?  I think I shall go
and have a fivepenny-ha'penny repeat.
</p>

<p>
I say, what are you doing about the weather?
Are you taking it lying down?  I want to sign a
petition, or write to my M.P. (haven't got one, then
I shall write to yours), humbly showing that it's
the rottenest do there's ever been.  Do you
remember the story (it comes in Gesta Romanorum, or
should) of the man who built a model of another
man and threw things at it, and the other man sat
in a bath with a mirror in his hand and whenever
the first man threw he ducked under the water.  If
he got under in time his enemy missed, and it was
all right.  Otherwise he was killed.  Well, I am
going to rig up a Negretti in my room, and throw
boots at it, and if the original has to spend all his
time in a cold bath ducking, I <i>think</i>, Charles, we shall
get some warmer weather soon.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, how this spring of love resembleth<br>
  The uncertain glory of an April day."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Charles, in your courting days was she ever as cold
to you as this?
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Don't talk to me about politics,
or the weather, or anything; I have lost my tobacco-pouch.
Oh, Charles, what is to be done?  It is too sad.
</p>

<p>
I bought it in a little shop at Ambleside, my first,
my only friend, on the left-hand side as you go down
the hill.  It was descended from a brown crocodile
in the male line, and a piece of indiarubber in the
female; at least, I suppose so, but the man wouldn't
say for certain.  He called it a trade term.  I smoked
my first pipe from it&mdash;on the top of Scafell Pike, with
all England at my feet.  The ups and downs it has
seen since then&mdash;the sweet-smelling briars it has met!
In sickness and in sorrow it comforted me; in happiness
it kept me calm.  Old age came upon it slowly,
beautifully.  In these later years how many men
have looked at it with awe; how many women
have insulted it and&mdash;stitched its dear sides together!
</p>

<p>
It passed away on a Saturday, Charles; this scion
of the larger Reptilia, which sprang into being among
the mountain-tops, passed away in a third-class
carriage at Dulwich!  The irony of it!  Even
Denmark Hill&mdash;&mdash;  But it matters not now I have lost
it.  Nor can I bear that another should take its
place.  Perhaps in a year or two ... I cannot say
... but for the present I make shift with an envelope.
</p>

<p>
Two thoughts sustain me.  First, that no strange
eye will recognise it as a tobacco-pouch, no strange
hand (therefore) dip into it.  Secondly, that the
Fates, which have taken from me my dearest possession,
must needs have some great happiness in store
for me.
</p>

<p>
Charles, I perceive you are crying; let us turn to
more cheerful things.  Do you play croquet?  I
have just joined a croquet club (don't know why),
and one of the rules is that you have to supply your
own mallet.  How do you do this?  Of course, I
know that ultimately I hand a certain sum of money
to a shopman, and he gives me a very awkward
parcel in exchange; but what comes before that?
I have often bought a bat, and though I have not
yet selected one which could make runs, I can
generally find something which is pretty comfortable
to carry back into the pavilion.  But I have never
chosen a mallet.  What sort of weight should it be,
and is it a good thing to say it "doesn't come up
very well"?  I have, they tell me, a tendency to
bowness in the legs and am about a million round
the biceps; I suppose all that is rather important?
Perhaps they have their mallets classified for different
customers, and you have only to describe yourself to
them.  I shall ask for a <i>Serviceable mallet for a blond</i>.
"Serviceable" means that if you hit the ground very
hard by accident it doesn't break; some of these
highly strung mallets splinter up at once, you know.
As a matter of fact, you can't miss the ball at croquet,
can you?  I am thinking of golf.  What about
having a splice with mine; is that done much?  I
don't want to go on to the ground looking a perfect
ass with no splice, when everybody else has two or
three.  Croquet is a jolly game, because you don't
have to worry about what sort of collar you'll wear;
you just play in your ordinary things.  All the same,
I shall have some spikes put in my boots so as not to
slip.  I once took in to dinner the sister of the All
England Croquet Champion.  I did really.
Unfortunately I didn't happen to strike her subject,
and she didn't strike mine&mdash;<i>Butterflies</i>.  How bitterly
we shall regret that evening&mdash;which was a very jolly
one all the same.  Here am I, not knowing a
bit how to select a mallet, and there possibly is she,
having just found the egg of the Purple Emperor,
labelling it in her collection as that of the Camberwell
Beauty.  Let this be a lesson to all of us.
</p>

<p>
Charles, I feel very silly to-night; I must be what
they call "fey," which is why I ask you&mdash;How
would you like to be a pedigree goat?  I have just
seen in an evening paper a picture of Mr Brown "with
his pedigree goat."  Somehow it had never occurred
to me that a goat could have a pedigree; but I see
now that it might be so.  I think if I had to be a
goat at all I should like to be a pedigree one.  In a
way, I suppose, every goat has a pedigree of some
kind; but you would need to have a pretty
distinguished one to be spoken of as a P.G.  Your
father, Charles, would need to have had some
renown among the bearded ones; your great-uncle
must have been of the blood.  And if this were so,
I should, in your place, insist upon being
photographed as a pedigree goat "with Mr
Brown."  Don't stand any nonsense about that.
</p>

<p>
If I ever have a goat, and you won't let me call it
Charles, I shall call it David.  My eldest brother,
you, know, was christened David, and called so for
a year; but at the end of that time we had a
boot-and-knife-boy who was unfortunately named David
too.  (I say "we," but I was still in the Herebefore
myself.)  This led to great confusion.  When the
nurse called for David to come and take his bottle,
it was very vexing to find the other David turning
up with a brown shoe in one hand and a fish-knife in
the other.  Something had to be done.  The baby
was just beginning to take notice; the leather
polisher had just refused to.  In the circumstances
the only thing was to call the baby by his second
name.
</p>

<p>
Two or three years passed rapidly, and I arrived.
Just as this happened, the boot-boy took the last
knife and went.  Now was our chance.  My second
name had already been fixed; it was immediately
decided that my first should be David.  The new
boot-boy didn't mind a bit; everybody else seemed
delighted ... and then someone remembered that
in ten years' time I should be going to school.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Charles, the initials D.A.M....  You know
what boys are; it would have been very awkward.
</p>

<p>
And so now you see why I am going to call my
pedigree goat David.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;I am learning to dance the
minuet.  I say "the" instead of "a" because I
am sure mine is a very particular kind of one.  You
start off with three slides to the left, then three to
the right, and then you stop and waggle the left leg.
After that you bow to your partner in acknowledgement
of the interest she has taken in it all, and that
ends the first figure.  There are lots more, but one
figure at a time is my motto.  At present I slide well,
but I am a moderate waggler.
</p>

<p>
<i>Why</i> am I doing this, you ask.  My dear Charles,
you never know when a little thing like a minuet will
turn out useful.  The time may well come when you
will say to yourself, "Ah, if only I had seized the
opportunity of learning that when I was young,
how ... etc."  There were once two men who were
cast ashore on a desert island.  One of them had an
axe, and a bag of nails, and a goat, and a box of
matches, and a barrel of gunpowder, and a keg of
biscuits, and a tarpaulin and some fish-hooks.  The
other could only dance the minuet.  Years rolled
by; and one day a ship put in at that island for
water.  As a matter of fact, there was no water
there, but they found two skeletons.  Which shows
that in certain circumstances proficiency in the
minuet is as valuable as an axe, and a bag of nails,
and a goat and a box of matches, and all the other
things that I mentioned just now.  So I am learning
in case.
</p>

<p>
My niece, aged twenty months (do I bore you?),
has made her first joke: let it be put on record and
handed down to those that come after.  She walked
into the study, where her father was reading and her
mother writing.  They agreed not to take any notice
of her, in order to see what would happen.  She
marched up to her father, stroked his face, and said,
"Hallo, daddy!"  No answer.  She gazed round;
and then went over to the writing-desk.  "Hallo,
mummy!"  Dead silence.  She stood for a moment
looking rather puzzled.  At last she went back to
her father, bent down and patted his slippers and
said, "Hallo, boots!"  Then she walked quite
happily out of the room.
</p>

<p>
However, we won't bother about her, because I
have something much more exciting to tell you.
M'Gubbin has signed on for the something Rovers
for next season!  I saw it in the paper; it had a
little paragraph all to itself.  This is splendid
news&mdash;I haven't been so happy about anything for a
long time.  Whaur's your Wully Gaukrodger now?
Let us arrange a Pentathlon for them.  I'll back
M'G., and you can hold the towel for Gauk.  My
man would win at football of course, and yours at
cricket, but the other three events would be exciting.
Chess, golf and the minuet, I think.  I can see
M'Gubbin sliding&mdash;<i>one</i>, two, three, <i>one</i>, two three&mdash;there,
now he's waggling his left leg.  Charles, you're
a goner&mdash;hand over the stakes.
</p>

<p>
Look here, I smoke too much, at least I have been
lately.  Let's give it up, Charles.  I'll give it up
altogether for a week if you will.  Did you know
that you can allay the craving for tobacco by the
judicious use of bull's-eyes?  ("Allay" is the
word.)  You carry a bag of bull's-eyes with you&mdash;I
swear this is true, I saw it in the press&mdash;and whenever
you feel a desire to smoke you just pop a bull's-eye
in your mouth.  In a little while, they say, your
taste for tobacco&mdash;and I imagine for everything
else&mdash;is quite gone.  This ought to be more widely
known, and then your host would say, "Try one
of these bull's-eyes, won't you?  I import them
direct," and you would reply, "Thanks very much,
but I would rather have one of my own, if I may."  "Have
a bull's-eye, if you like," your partner would
say at a dance.  Of course, too, they would have
special bull's-eye compartments in trains; that
would be jolly.  But it would ruin the stage.  The
hero who always lights a cigarette before giving off
his best epigram&mdash;I don't know what he'd do.  You
see he couldn't ... well, he'd have to wait such a
time.
</p>

<p>
Why are they called bull's-eyes?  I don't believe
I've ever seen a bull's-eye really close.  If you look
a bull in the eye he doesn't go for you.  Which eye?
He might be a left-handed bull; you'd look at the
wrong eye; then where would you be?
</p>

<p>
The world is too much with me, Charles, but all
the same I've just ordered a flannel suit which will
make Castle Bumpbrook stare.  Sort of purplish;
and it makes up very smart, and they can do me two
pairs of trousers in it, whatever that means.  I
should have thought they could have done me as
many pairs as I liked to ask for, but it seems not.
They only print a limited edition, and then destroy
the original plates, so that nobody else can walk
about looking like me.  I asked the man if he
thought it would play croquet well, and he said, yes.
By the way, I have learnt some more about
croquet since I wrote last.  First, then, you can go
round in one, if you're frightfully good.  I should
like to go round in one; I suppose that would be the
record?  Secondly, if you're wired from all the balls,
"so that you can't get a clear shot at every part of
any one of them," you go into baulk, and have
another turn.  This must happen pretty often,
because you could never have a clear shot at the back
of a ball, unless you went right round the world the
other way, and that would be too risky, besides
wasting so much time.  No, I can see there's a lot
to learn in the game, but patience, Charles, patience.
I shall go round in one yet.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p>
DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Are you coming up to town this
month?  If you do we will make a journey into
Shepherd's Bush together, and see the Exhibition.
</p>

<p>
I am afraid I have been doing Shepherd's Bush an
injustice all these years.  John and I once arranged
a system of seven hells, in which we put all the men
we hated.  Nobody known personally to either of
us was eligible (so your name never came up, dear
Charles), which meant that they had to be filled with
people in the public eye.  The seventh division
contained two only: one a socialist, who is thought a
good deal of&mdash;by himself, I mean; the other a
novelist who only writes about superior people who
drop their "g's."  The punishment for this class was
simple; perpetual life in an open boat on a choppy
sea, smoking Virginian cigarettes&mdash;John's idea
chiefly, he being a bad sailor.  The doom decreed
for the unfortunates in the fifth class&mdash;now I am
coming to the point of this reminiscence&mdash;was more
subtle: they had to live at Shepherd's Bush, and go
to a musical comedy every afternoon.
</p>

<p>
There were four men in the fifth class.  Three of
them we need not bother about, but the latest arrival
was a certain cleric who advertised a good deal.
One day we met somebody who knew him well.  We
broke the sad news to him gently, and he was much
distressed about it.  He asked if there was any hope.
We replied that if his friend turned over a new
leaf, and kept his name out of the papers for a bit,
he might in time be promoted into the fourth
division&mdash;where, every day, you watched Sussex play Essex
at Leyton and had mutton sandwiches for lunch.  He
was so glad to hear this that he made us promise to
let him know when any such step was meditated.
Accordingly, after a month of perfect quiet on the
part of the reverend gentleman we sent his friend a
telegram: "Bernard left Shepherd's Bush by the
nine o'clock steamer this morning."

<p>
And now it looks as if the Bush were much more
of a place than we thought.
</p>

<p>
Every week or so I have an inspiration; and I had
one yesterday, when the thought struck me suddenly
that it would be a good idea to buy some postcards.
You get them at the post office&mdash;six stout ones for
ninepence.  Oh no, that can't be right&mdash;nine stout
ones for sixpence.  I shouldn't think a postcard
would ever get too stout&mdash;not unpleasantly so, I
mean; you hardly ever see an obese postcard.  I
don't believe I have used one of any dimensions for
ten years; yet they are such handy things when you
want to say "Right O" or don't quite know whether
you are "very truly" or "sincerely."  The postcard
touch is hereditary.  Some families have it,
ours hasn't.  But now it is going to begin.
Tomorrow I buy as many stout ones for sixpence as
they will give me.
</p>

<p>
Talking of buying croquet mallets and things&mdash;I
went into a little tobacconist's a little while ago
(What for?  Guess), and while I was there a man
came in and ordered a pipe, two ounces of bird's-eye,
and a box of matches.  I wanted to tell him that you
really required a rubber pouch as well, and a little
silver thing for pressing down the tobacco.  It must
want some nerve to start straight off like that,
especially at his age&mdash;forty or so.  I am about to
play golf seriously, and I shall certainly get my
clubs at different shops&mdash;a driver at the Stores, a
putter in Piccadilly, a niblick (what's a niblick?
Anyhow, I shall have several of them, because of the
name)&mdash;and several niblicks in Fleet Street.  It would
be too absurd to buy a dozen assorted clubs, one ball,
a jersey and a little red flag all at the same place.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I should love to come down and play cricket
for Castle Bumpbrook, and many thanks for asking
me.  I don't make runs nowadays, Charles, but if
you feel that the mere presence of a gentleman from
Lunnon would inspire and, as it were, give tone to
the side, then I am at your service.  You do say
"Lunnon" in the country, don't you, when you
mean London?  And you say "bain't" too.  How
jolly!  "I bain't a bowler, zur"&mdash;and you pronounce
the "b-o-w" as if it were a curtsey and not a cravat.
"Put Oi&mdash;&mdash;"  It's no good.  I can't keep it up.
Put me in last and I'll make 3 not out, and that will
bring me top of the averages.  (If you divide 3 by
0 you get an awful lot, you know.)  You have an
average bat, I suppose?  I like them rather
light&mdash;or I would take the money, whichever would be
more convenient.
</p>

<p>
I have just written myself a letter, pleasantly
standoffish, but not haughty.  The reason is that
I have my doubts about the post office, so I am
giving them a test.  My address, as you have
discovered, is an awkward one.  There are nine distinct
ways of getting it wrong, and most people try two
or three of them.  But the letters do get here
eventually, after (I expect) a good deal of sickness
on the part of the postman.  What I am beginning
to wonder now is whether a letter with the <i>right</i>
address would arrive; I fancy that the chief of the
detective department would suspect a trap, and send
it somewhere else; and, as I am certain that I have
never received one or two letters which I ought to
have had, I am writing to myself to see.
</p>

<p>
It is a great art, that of writing nicely to
yourself; to say enough, yet not too much.  When John
was getting engaged, he wrote to himself every day.
Before he started doing this he used to spend hours
sitting and wondering whether the postman had
been.  The few letters he had had from her came by
the eight-thirty post.  At eight-fifteen he began to
look out; nothing happened.  An awful quarter of
an hour followed.  Eight-thirty&mdash;no postman's
knock; never mind, perhaps he's late.
Eight-thirty-five&mdash;well, it <i>is</i> rather a busy time; besides
he may have fallen down.  Eight-forty&mdash;one ray
of light left; he did come once, you remember, at
eight-forty-two.  Eight-forty-five&mdash;despair.  A
half-an-hour's agony, you observe, Charles.  Then he
thought of writing to himself in time for that
delivery.  The result was that he remained quite calm,
knowing that the postman was bound to come.
"Ah, there he is.  Will there be a letter from her?
Yes&mdash;no."  You see?  Your heart in your mouth
for five seconds only.
</p>

<p>
I never saw any of these letters.  But I should
say that at the beginning they were sympathetic&mdash;"Buck
up, it's all right"&mdash;or hopeful&mdash;"Never
mind, she'll write to-morrow"; later on they would
become cynical&mdash;"Done in the eye again.  What on
earth do you expect?"; and, finally, I expect,
insulting&mdash;"You silly ass; chuck it." ... Then, of
course, she wrote.
</p>

<p>
Good-bye.  Don't forget I am going to play for
you.  Would it be side to wear flannels?  White
boots would be a bit lofty, anyhow.  Then I shall
wear one brown pad on the right leg.

</p>

<p>
DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;Many thanks for your letter.
Don't side just because you get up at six o'clock,
and feed the cow, or shave the goat, or whatever it is.
Other people get up early too.  For the last few
weeks I have sprung out of bed at seven-thirty.  (I
always "spring" out&mdash;it is so much more classy.)  But
I doubt if I can keep it up.
</p>

<p>
The truth is that I have just made an unhappy
discovery.  I was under the impression that my
man's name was Turley; I should say my third of
a man, because I share with him two others, but
anyhow I thought his whole name was Turley.  So I
used to write nice little notes, beginning, "If you're
waking, call me, Turley," and leave them about for
him.  He invariably woke at seven and read them&mdash;and
came and called me, mother dear.  Of course
I had to get up.  Well, I have now heard that his
name is really Holland, which makes all the
difference.  It would be absurd to write him any more
notes of that kind.  My one satisfaction is that I
can claim to own a third of Holland, which is about
4000 square miles.  Multiply that by 640 and you
get it in acres.  Altogether the landowner.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Charles, my lad, you are not the one
person who knows things about animals.  You may
be on terms of familiarity with the cow and the goat,
but these are not the only beasts.  What acquaintance,
for example, have you with reptiles?  The
common newt&mdash;do you know anything about <i>him</i>?
No.  Well, then, now I'll tell you.
</p>

<p>
When I was seven and John was eight, we went to
a naturalist's in Hampstead to inquire the price of
newts.  They were threepence each, not being quite
in season.  We bought sixpennyworth; the man
put them into a paper bag for us, and we took them
up on the Heath to give them a gallop.  When we
opened the bag we found <i>three</i> newts inside.  It
seemed impossible that the thing could have happened
naturally, so we went back to the shop to explain to
the man that he had made a mistake.  However, he
hadn't; he had merely given us one newt discount.
(Remember that when next you're buying them.)  Well,
we returned to the Heath, and they showed
their paces.  Now the newt is an amphibious animal
(Greek); he is as much at ease in the bathroom as
on the mat.  So when we got them home we arranged
to try them in our bath.
</p>

<p>
This is where you cry.  For a time all went well.
They dived, swam (back and front), trod water,
returned to life when apparently drowned, and so
forth.  Then John pulled up the waste-pipe.  He
says now that he did it inadvertently, but I fancy
that he wanted to see what would happen.  What
did happen was that they got into the whirlpool and
disappeared.  We turned on both the hot and cold
taps to see if they would come back, but they didn't.
Apparently you don't.  We rushed into the garden
to see if they would return by the drain-pipe with
the rainwater, but not they.  Only the paper bag
was left to us ... and (to this day I cannot recall
it without a tear) it was John who popped it.
</p>

<p>
Charles, we never saw those newts again.  Crusoe,
Cleaver and Robinson were their names.  Robinson
and Crusoe they were to have been; and when the
third came, and seemed to take a fancy to Robinson,
we called him Cleaver.  Where are they now?  In
the mighty Thames somewhere, I suppose.  So,
Charles, if ever you are near the river, keep a friendly
eye open for them, will you?  They may be a little
wild now, but they were good newts in their day.
</p>

<p>
We had a <i>Buforium</i> too in our time, you must
know.  I have just made that word up, and it means
a place where you keep toads.  In our case it was
the sink.  The toad, as you may not have realised,
has no vomerine or maxillary teeth, but he <i>has</i> got a
distinct tympanum.  However, what I really wanted
to say was that the toad has a pyriform tongue of
incredible length, by means of which he catches his
prey&mdash;thus differing from the frog, which leaps at
'em.  We used to station a toad opposite one of the
walls of the sink&mdash;of the <i>Buforium</i>&mdash;and then run his
breakfast down the side.  Sometimes it would be a
very long centipede, and then you could have one
toad for each end; or a&mdash;&mdash;  What brutes little
boys are; I'm not going to tell you any more about
toads.  (Except to say that his omosternum is
generally missing.  That must be very annoying.)
</p>

<p>
Did I ever talk to you about hedgehogs?  We
kept no end of them, but Peter was the only one who
stayed.  He used to live in the scullery, so as to see
that no black-beetles got about.  One night the cook
woke up suddenly and remembered that she had left
the scullery tap running.  So she jumped out of bed
and ran downstairs, not even stopping to put on
slippers....
</p>

<p>
She was a very heavy woman....  No, Peter
wasn't hurt much; but she refused to have him in
the kitchen again.
</p>

<p>
This is a very zoological letter, but I just wanted
to show you that you weren't the only one.  Time
fails me to tell you of a mole which we put in the
geranium-bed, of a certain kind of caterpillar from
which we caught nettlerash, of a particularly
handsome triton which we kept in a tank with a crab,
giving them fresh and salt water on alternative days,
so that there should be no quarrelling.  It is enough
if I have made it clear that one does not need to have
Castle Bumpbrook on one's notepaper in order to
commune with nature.
</p>

<p>
I want two wedding presents&mdash;I don't mean for
myself.  What do you suggest?  I bar anything for
the table.  Newly married couples might do nothing
but eat to judge from the things they get given them.
At present I hesitate between the useful&mdash;as, for
instance, twenty thousand cubic feet of gas&mdash;and
the purely ornamental&mdash;say, an antimacassar.  "Mr
and Mrs Samuel Jones&mdash;a towel-horse": you never
see that, do you?  And yet you could pay anything
for a pure-bred one, and they are very useful.  The
bride always wears "valuable old Honiton lace, the
gift of her aunt."  Otherwise it's not legal.  Kitty
never had an aunt, had she?  Then you aren't
properly married, Charles.  I'm sorry.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
VIII
</p>

<p>
DEAR CHARLES,&mdash;A thing has just happened to
me, which really only happens to people in jokes.
You would not believe it did I not lay my hand on my
heart&mdash;(the heart isn't on the left side, as you thought,
by the way.  It's bang in the middle, only the left
auricle does all the work.  However)&mdash;on my heart,
and swear that it is true.
</p>

<p>
I was in the silver department of Liberty's buying
some spoons.  Yes, I fell back on spoons after all.
(Never fall back on a spoon, Charles, if you can help
it.)  It was a hot day and the business of selection
was so exhausting that I took off my hat and gloves,
and laid them on a chair beside me.  When it was
all over the man went off to make out the bill.  I
wandered round the place, looking at all the other
things which I wished I had bought instead.
Suddenly a voice at my side said:
</p>

<p>
"Can you tell me if this is where you get ladies'
jerseys for golf?"
</p>

<p>
(I told you you had to get a jersey for golf.)
</p>

<p>
I said: "Oh, do you think that is a good thing?
I rather thought of spoons myself....  I mean, for
a wedding present one does want something which
... Oh, I beg your pardon....  Yes, I am Mr
Liberty.  No liberty at all, madam, I assure you....
This is the silver department, you know....
Yes, all that white shiny stuff....  Well, I daresay
we could do you one, if you wouldn't mind having
the lion worked on it....  No, we don't charge for
the lion....  Or what about something quite
simple in pewter....  Oh, I see....  The art
muslin department would be the nearest thing we
have ...  a freer swing, certainly....  Good-morning."
</p>

<p>
Well, no, I didn't say that exactly.  Having my
hand on the left side of my heart it would be
impossible to pretend that I did.  With the best
intentions in the world, how easy it is, Lucy, to slip
from the rocky path of truth into the crevasse of
make-believe.  (Maxim from "The Fairchild Family.")
But really and really, Charles, she did take me for
the shopwalker in the silver department, and she
did ask for ladies' golf jerseys.  What I actually
said was: "I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid I'm only
a customer."  And she said, "Oh, I'm so sorry."  And
then I put on my hat to show that I had one,
and took it off again to show that I knew my manners,
and she went off to the clock counter, and said she
was sorry to trouble the man behind it, but could he
tell her where she went for ladies' jerseys for golf,
and he said he was very sorry, they didn't sell them,
but would she like some clocks on her stockings
instead.  Altogether there was a good deal of sorrow
going about.
</p>

<p>
But not on my part&mdash;never.  In common tweeds,
to be mistaken for one of those splendid frock-coated
gentleman, and admitted into a lady's confidence on
a question of jerseys, there was glory for you.  I
doubt now if I ought to have gone down to Castle
Bumpbrook.  Anyhow, I should have insisted on all
the gate.
</p>

<p>
What was the gate?  I distinctly saw three small
boys hiding behind a cow.  I suppose they paid all
right?  Charles, I did enjoy it awfully, as I think
I have told you several times.  It was good of you
to send me in first with the postman, and as a
post-man I am sure I should love him very much, but he
is too fast for me on the cricket-field.  There wasn't
a run there, you know&mdash;a simple shot straight to
cover.  I expect he thought it was an express
delivery or late fee stroke, with "Immediate" in the
top left-hand corner; or perhaps the brown pad
made him think I was a telegram.  If I ever go in
first with him again I shall register myself.
</p>

<p>
I gather that the vicar <i>has</i> to bowl at one end all
the time, hasn't he?  In lieu of tithes or something.
Otherwise you get the Ecclesiastical Commissioners
down on you.  He varies his pitch cleverly, I admit.
His firstly would take any batsman by surprise; I
can't think why it only bounces once&mdash;finger-spin,
I suppose.  Then, immediately afterwards, you get
his secondly, a high full pitch which would almost
be a wide in a layman.  Yet all the time you feel
that he is only leading up to his sixthly and lastly,
my brethren, which is one of the subtlest half-volleys
I have ever seen.
</p>

<p>
Charles, I love your garden.  It was jolly to see
the white flower of Mrs Sinkins' blameless life again.
I knew Mrs Sinkins as a bulb&mdash;I mean as a boy, and
have always regarded her with affection.  I suppose
I shall have to wait for Dorothy Perkins.  She is
hardly out yet.  My love is like a&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, but
Dorothy is pink.  Anyhow, she sweetly smiles in
June, and it's just on June, so I'm blowed if I don't
come down to see her next month, whether you ask
me or not.  Better send me an invitation for form's
sake.
</p>

<p>
And teach me about flowers, will you?  (And I
will tell you about motor omnibuses.) Why do they
all end in "kins"?  It can't be a coincidence that
the only two which I know to talk to should do this.
Funnily enough, motor omnibuses all end in Putney,
which shows that this is a very small world after all,
and we needs must love the highest when we see it.
So near and yet so far.  Doesn't it annoy you when
you meet a person in London whom you last saw in
Uganda, and he fatuously observes that the world is
a very small place?  It would have been a much
smaller place, <i>prima facie</i>, if you had last seen him at
Leamington.
</p>

<p>
To return to Dorothy; we have flowers in London,
too.  What about the Temple Show?  I saw a man
there with a kodak; I suppose he wanted to snap
the roses as they were growing.  That's the sort of
weather we are on the Embankment!  Oh, but the
fruit there!  I wish I were a prize tomato; what a
complexion!
